"Certainly! Here is a comprehensive **summary of relevant factors** for classifying ""dos"" (Denial of Service) flows, based on the 100 explanations you provided:

## **Key Characteristics of ""dos"" Flows**

### 1. **Abnormal TCP Flag Combinations**

- **SYN+FIN**: The simultaneous presence of SYN and FIN flags in the same flow (or even the same packet) is highly unusual for normal TCP communication. Normally, SYN starts a connection and FIN ends it.
- **SYN+FIN+ACK**: Seeing SYN, FIN, and ACK set within a single short flow is a strong indicator of attack/malformed traffic.
- **PSH, ACK, SYN, FIN**: Some flows also include PSH (Push) and ACK with SYN+FIN, increasing suspicion.
- **Rapid or malformed flag sequences**: Multiple flag types in a very brief flow, or out-of-order flag usage (e.g., SYN and FIN close together), is not typical of normal sessions.

### 2. **Short Duration & Packet Burst**

- **Very short-lived flows**: Durations are typically in the **1–10 millisecond range**.
- **Multiple packets in a brief window**: Often 3–6 packets in just a few milliseconds.
- **High packet rate**: The ratio of packets to duration is much higher than normal user or application traffic.

### 3. **Small Amount of Data**

- **Low byte counts**: Typically, flows have only a few hundred bytes (e.g., 200–600 bytes), suggesting incomplete or non-substantive sessions.
- **No evidence of full data exchanges**: Not enough data for a full HTTP transaction or file transfer.

### 4. **Unusual Source/Destination Port Patterns**

- **Source port 80**: Port 80 is normally a destination port for HTTP servers. Its use as a source port is suspicious—may suggest spoofing or crafted packets.
- **Single target port**: The flows usually target a single service port (often 80), not a range, distinguishing them from port scans.
- **High destination port**: Sometimes, high ephemeral ports are targeted, which may be an attempt to find open services or evade detection.

### 5. **No Evidence of Legitimate Session Progression**

- **Incomplete TCP handshake**: No evidence of the full SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK sequence.
- **No sustained data transfer**: Sessions are too short and too small to represent normal user activity.

### 6. **Not Consistent with Other Attack Types**

- **Not port scans**: Port scans typically involve many destination ports or multiple flows to different ports, not just one.
- **Not brute force**: Brute force attacks usually show repeated login attempts and longer flows to authentication services.
- **Not ping scans**: Ping scans use ICMP, not TCP.

### 7. **Pattern Consistency**

- **Repetition**: These flows often occur in bursts or are repeated many times from the same or multiple sources.
- **Target is a common service**: Port 80 (HTTP) is a common victim in the dataset, but any public-facing service can be targeted.

## **Summary Table of DoS Indicators**

| Feature           | DoS Indicator                          | Typical Value in DoS Flows             |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| TCP Flags         | SYN+FIN, SYN+FIN+ACK, etc.             | .A..SF, .AP.SF, etc.                   |
| Duration          | Extremely short                        | 0.001–0.01 seconds                     |
| Packets           | Small, rapid bursts                    | 3–6 packets                            |
| Bytes             | Low                                    | 200–600 bytes                          |
| Source Port       | Unusual (e.g., 80 as source)           | 80 or high ephemeral port               |
| Dest Port         | Single service port (e.g., 80)         | 80 or high ephemeral port              |
| Session Pattern   | Incomplete handshake, rapid close      | No full handshake or data exchange     |
| Data Volume       | Minimal                                | No full application transaction        |
| Attack Pattern    | Repeated, bursty, abnormal flags       | Many short flows in quick succession   |

## **Conclusion**

**A ""dos"" flow is characterized by:**
- Very short duration and small size,
- Abnormal or crafted TCP flag combinations (especially SYN+FIN, SYN+FIN+ACK, with or without PSH/ACK),
- Absence of legitimate session progression,
- Unusual source/destination port usage (source port 80, ephemeral ports),
- Rapid, bursty packet transmission,
- Not matching port scan, brute force, or ping scan behaviors,
- Often repeated as part of a larger pattern.

**When classifying flows, prioritize:**  
- Abnormal TCP flag combinations  
- Short, incomplete, bursty flows  
- Unusual port usage  
- Patterns of repetition  
- Lack of legitimate session or data transfer

**By considering these factors, you can robustly distinguish DoS attack flows from normal and other attack types.**"
