bruteForce,"

Explanation: 1

Let's carefully **analyze the flow and its attributes**:

### Flow Attributes
- **Start Time:** 2017-03-20 11:28:52.094  
- **Duration:** 0.0 (very short, possibly a single packet)
- **Protocol:** UDP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source Port:** 137  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.255  
- **Destination Port:** 137  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 92  
- **Flags:** ...... (all dots, which means no TCP flags; makes sense since this is UDP)

### What does this represent?
- **Port 137** is commonly associated with **NetBIOS Name Service** (used in Windows networking for name resolution).
- **Destination IP 192.168.220.255** is a **broadcast address** for the subnet `192.168.220.0/24`.  
- This is a single UDP packet, from one host to the broadcast address, on port 137.

### The Labels
- **""---""**: No attack, normal flow
- **""dos""**: Denial of service attack
- **""portScan""**: Port Scan attack
- **""bruteForce""**: Bruteforce attack
- **""pingScan""**: Ping Scan attack

---

## Why was this classified as ""bruteForce""?

### Typical Characteristics of a Brute Force Attack
A **brute force attack** typically involves **repeated attempts to guess credentials or keys**, usually characterized by:
- Multiple attempts to connect/authenticate/log in
- Often TCP-based (especially SSH, FTP, RDP, HTTP)
- Many packets over some duration

### Does this flow fit that?
- **No**: This flow is a **single UDP packet**, with no evidence of repeated attempts or authentication activity.

---

### Analysis of the Likely Reason for the Misclassification

1. **Possible Heuristic/Model Error**:
    - Some intrusion detection systems flag any NetBIOS broadcast as suspicious, but **NetBIOS broadcasts are common in local networks**, especially in Windows environments.
    - If the classifier was trained on a dataset where NetBIOS broadcasts were performed as part of a brute force attack (e.g., attempting to enumerate or guess NetBIOS names), it might have learned to associate **UDP/137 broadcasts** with ""bruteForce"" activity.
    - However, **a single packet** is not enough evidence for ""bruteForce"".

2. **Incorrect Label**:
    - Given the provided data, this flow **should not be classified as ""bruteForce""**. It looks like **normal NetBIOS broadcast traffic**.
    - There is **no evidence of repeated attempts, login trials, or credential guessing**.

---

## **Conclusion/Explanation**

**The flow was likely classified as ""bruteForce"" because the classifier associated UDP port 137 broadcast traffic with brute force attacks, possibly due to training data bias or mislabelling. However, based on network analysis, this flow is a single NetBIOS Name Service broadcast and does not exhibit brute force characteristics.**

**In reality, this flow should be classified as ""---"" (No attack, normal flow).**

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute   | Value                       | Typical for BruteForce?         |
|-------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Protocol    | UDP (not TCP)               | No                              |
| Port        | 137 (NetBIOS)               | No (Brute force usually targets login services)|
| Packets     | 1                           | No (Should be many)             |
| Duration    | 0.0                         | No (Should be longer)           |
| Dest IP     | Broadcast                   | No                              |
| Flags       | None (UDP)                  | N/A                             |

---

### **If you need a justification using the attributes:**

> **The classifier may have associated UDP traffic on port 137 (NetBIOS) to the broadcast address as indicative of brute force enumeration (attempting to discover NetBIOS names by broadcasting queries to the subnet). However, a single packet does not constitute a brute force attack. This is more likely a normal broadcast for name resolution on a Windows network. The classification as ""bruteForce"" is likely an error.**

---

**If you want a one-line answer:**

> The flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" likely because the model associated UDP port 137 broadcast traffic with brute force attacks, but in reality, this is a normal NetBIOS broadcast and not a brute force activity.


Explanation: 2

Certainly! Let’s analyze the flow attributes and explain why it was classified as **""bruteForce""**:

### **Flow Attributes Analysis**

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 12:38:44.674  
- **Duration:** 0.181 seconds (very short)
- **Transport Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.100.4
- **Source Port:** 22 *(SSH)*
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Destination Port:** 51850
- **Packets:** 11
- **Bytes:** 2085
- **TCP Flags:** .AP.S.
    - **A:** ACK
    - **P:** PSH (push)
    - **S:** SYN (synchronize)

---

### **Label Reasoning**

#### **1. Source and Destination Ports**
- **Source Port 22:** This is the default port for SSH (Secure Shell).
- **Destination Port 51850:** High, ephemeral port (typical for client connections).

#### **2. Number of Packets and Bytes in a Short Duration**
- **11 packets and 2085 bytes** transferred in only **0.181 seconds** suggests a burst of activity.

#### **3. TCP Flags**
- **.AP.S.**: This sequence suggests a connection initiation (SYN), followed by data transfer (PSH, ACK).
- This pattern is typical for SSH authentication attempts, as a brute force tool would quickly open a connection, attempt authentication, and possibly close or move to the next attempt.

#### **4. Typical Brute Force Behavior**
- **Brute force attacks** on SSH involve rapidly trying multiple username/password combinations, often in a short time, leading to multiple short-lived connections to port 22.
- Each attempt may result in several packets (for handshake and authentication data) in a very short period.
- The flow described matches that: a quick burst of packets and bytes over SSH (port 22).

#### **5. Why not other attacks?**
- **DoS:** Usually involves large numbers of packets/bytes or repeated connection attempts to overwhelm a service, not just a few packets.
- **PortScan:** Would show many destination ports, not just one.
- **PingScan:** Uses ICMP protocol, not TCP.
- **Normal:** Normal SSH connections typically last longer and have different flag/packet patterns.

---

### **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- The traffic is directed to SSH (port 22), a common target for brute force attacks.
- The flow is very short but contains multiple packets and some data, typical of repeated, rapid authentication attempts.
- The flag pattern and bursty, short-lived connection are characteristic of brute force SSH attacks, rather than normal usage or other attack types.

**In summary:**  
*The combination of short duration, multiple packets, use of SSH, and the TCP flags all indicate behavior consistent with brute force attacks, hence the classification.*


Explanation: 3

Let's break down the flow's details and explain why it was classified as **""bruteForce""**:

---

### 1. **Flow details recap**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-21 13:21:18.055  
- **Duration:** 0.16 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.200.4  
- **Source port:** 22  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Destination port:** 44753  
- **Packets:** 11  
- **Bytes:** 2085  
- **TCP Flags:** .AP.S.

### 2. **What is a BruteForce attack?**
A **BruteForce attack** usually refers to systematically trying many passwords or keys in order to gain unauthorized access to a system or service. In network traffic, brute force attacks are often seen as a series of rapid, repeated authentication attempts against services like SSH (port 22).

### 3. **Flow analysis**

#### **a. Source and destination ports**
- **Source port 22:** This means the flow originated *from* port 22, which is the standard port for **SSH**.
- **Destination port 44753:** This is a high, likely ephemeral port, probably used by a client.

However, in most cases, *incoming* connections to SSH would have destination port 22, and the *source* port would be high (ephemeral). Here, the flow is *from* 22 to a high port, suggesting this is traffic *from the SSH server to a client* (maybe a response to an attempted login).

#### **b. Duration and Packets**
- **Duration:** 0.16 seconds — very short.
- **Packets:** 11 in such a short time — could indicate a burst of rapid communication (like several rapid authentication attempts).

#### **c. TCP Flags**
- **.AP.S.**: This is a concatenation of the flags seen during the flow (**A**CK, **P**SH, **S**YN). These flags are common in SSH sessions where data transfer and connection establishment take place.

#### **d. Bytes**
- **2085 bytes** in 0.16 seconds is a relatively high volume for a single short-lived connection, likely indicating multiple authentication data exchanges.

### 4. **Why not other attack types?**
- **""dos"":** Would usually have much higher packet rates, more connections, and possibly to a wider port range, and often involves overwhelming a service, not interacting with SSH like this.
- **""portScan"":** Would involve many destination ports, not just one.
- **""pingScan"":** Would use ICMP, not TCP on port 22.
- **""---"":** A normal flow would likely have a longer duration with fewer packets in such a short time, or would not show the bursty pattern seen here.

### 5. **Conclusion**
**Why ""bruteForce""?**

- **SSH (port 22) is a common target for brute force attacks.**
- **Short duration (0.16s) with multiple packets and substantial data**: This can indicate automated, rapid login attempts rather than a legitimate session.
- **TCP Flags (.AP.S.)**: Suggests a session with data transfer, possibly failed authentication exchanges.
- **High destination port:** Implies the server is sending data back to a client, maybe in response to repeated, failed login attempts.
- **High packet count in a short burst:** Consistent with brute force tools that try many logins rapidly.

**Summary:**  
This flow shows bursty, short-lived, high-packet-count traffic from an SSH server to a client, which is **characteristic of a brute force attack** — likely multiple rapid authentication attempts (and server responses) over SSH in a short time span.

---

**If you have more flows or more context, the classification could be further refined, but based on this flow alone, the pattern fits brute force activity well.**


Explanation: 4

Let's break down the attributes of your network flow and analyze why it may have been classified as **""bruteForce""**:

---

### **Flow Attributes Recap**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 12:39:21.267
- **Duration:** 0.169 sec
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.100.4
- **Src port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Dest port:** 52229
- **Packets:** 11
- **Bytes:** 2085
- **Flags:** .AP.S.

---

## **Interpretation of Key Fields**

### **1. Source Port 22 (SSH)**
- SSH (port 22) is commonly targeted by brute force attacks because attackers often attempt to guess login credentials by trying multiple username/password combinations.

### **2. Destination Port 52229**
- This is a high, likely ephemeral port (randomly chosen by client), suggesting an outbound connection from the SSH server to a client. However, the flow direction (from 22 source) suggests the client initiated the connection to the server's port 22.

### **3. Number of Packets/Bytes**
- 11 packets and 2085 bytes in just 0.169 seconds is typical of an initial connection attempt, possibly with several rapid exchanges (e.g., failed login attempts, authentication negotiation, or immediate disconnects upon failure).

### **4. TCP Flags: .AP.S**
- The flags represent the sequence of TCP flag events.  
  - **S** (SYN): Start of connection
  - **A** (ACK): Acknowledgment
  - **P** (PSH): Push data (e.g., sending data immediately, often used during login attempts)
  - **.** (dot): No flag set for that packet

  The combination suggests:
  - The connection was established (SYN, ACK)
  - Data was exchanged (PSH)
  - The multiple packets with PSH and ACK could correspond to repeated login attempts or error messages being sent quickly.

---

## **Why Classified as ""bruteForce""?**

1. **Targeting SSH (Port 22):**
   - Brute force attacks often target SSH to gain unauthorized access.

2. **Short Duration, Multiple Packets:**
   - Multiple packets in a very short time can indicate automated login attempts, as opposed to normal human login activity.

3. **TCP Flag Pattern:**
   - The presence of PSH flags in quick succession can indicate repeated data pushes, often seen in automated login scripts.

4. **No Evidence of DoS, Scan, or Ping:**
   - DoS would typically involve a much higher volume of packets/bytes and possibly multiple destination ports.
   - PortScan or PingScan would involve connections to many different ports or ICMP packets, which is not seen here.

5. **Behavior Consistent with BruteForce:**
   - Automated tools for brute force attacks send many login attempts in quick succession, generating short, bursty flows like this one.

---

## **Summary**

**This network flow was likely classified as ""bruteForce"" because it:**
- Targets the SSH service (port 22)
- Has a pattern of rapid, repeated connections/attempts (11 packets in 0.169 seconds)
- Shows TCP flags indicative of multiple data exchanges in a short time

**All of these attributes are typical of brute force attempts to guess SSH credentials.**

Explanation: 5

Let's analyze the flow and its classification as **""bruteForce""**:

### Flow Details:
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:33:33.749  
- **Duration:** 0.0 (instantaneous)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source port:** 34391
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Destination port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 74
- **Flags:** ....S. (only the SYN flag is set)

---

### What does this flow represent?

- A **single TCP SYN packet** was sent from 192.168.220.16:34391 to 192.168.200.8:22.
- **Destination port 22** is the default port for SSH (Secure Shell).
- The flow only consists of the **SYN** flag, meaning this is the *first step in establishing a TCP connection* (the ""SYN"" of the ""SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK"" handshake).

---

### Why is this flow classified as ""bruteForce""?

**Brute Force attacks** against SSH typically involve trying many different username/password combinations by attempting to authenticate repeatedly. However, looking at this single flow, we only see the first step: an attempt to establish a connection.

**Key Points:**
- **Single SYN to SSH:** This packet is just an attempt to start a connection to SSH, which is *not enough by itself* to be a brute force.
- **No authentication attempt visible:** The flow does not show any data exchanged (which would include authentication attempts).

**Why would an IDS or flow classifier label this as ""bruteForce""?**
- **Contextual labeling:** In some datasets, especially for traffic analysis or machine learning, if a source sends *many* such SYN packets to the SSH port in a short time (even one per flow), the *collection* of flows is labeled as brute force. Sometimes, for simplicity, **every single SSH SYN flow from a ""malicious"" source IP is labeled as brute force**, even if, taken in isolation, it doesn't show the full attack.
- **Dataset bias:** The dataset or IDS may label all initial connection attempts to SSH as brute force if the source IP is known to be performing such attacks, based on prior or subsequent flows.
- **Lack of granularity:** Some flow-level datasets do not have the payload or session context, so they use the combination of destination port (22) and repeated attempts as a proxy for brute force.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute      | Value                     | Relevance to Brute Force Label         |
|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Dest Port      | 22 (SSH)                  | SSH is a common brute force target.    |
| TCP Flags      | SYN                       | Start of a connection.                 |
| Packets/Bytes  | 1 / 74                    | Just the connection attempt.           |
| Duration       | 0.0                       | Very short, just SYN sent.             |

---

### **Conclusion**

**This flow is a single SYN packet to SSH. By itself, it does not constitute a brute force attack. However,** in many datasets and detection systems, such flows are labeled 'bruteForce' **if they are part of a larger pattern (many such attempts from the same IP), or if the dataset is labeling all SSH SYNs from a known attacker as brute force attempts, even in isolation.**

**In short:**
- It is classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a TCP connection attempt to SSH, likely from a source known (in the dataset) to be conducting brute force attacks.
- The actual brute force attack would be evident only if there were many such flows from this source, or if subsequent flows show failed authentications.

**If you only have this one flow, the classification relies on context outside this record—**such as labeling policies or attack knowledge in the dataset.


Explanation: 6

Let's break down the flow attributes and see why it could be classified as **bruteForce**:

---

### Flow Details:

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 12:37:30.560  
- **Duration:** 0.012 seconds (very short)
- **Transport Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.100.4
- **Source port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Destination port:** 51442
- **Packets:** 5
- **Bytes:** 462
- **TCP Flags:** .AP..F

---

### Step-by-step Reasoning

#### 1. **Source Port 22 (SSH)**
- Port 22 is the default port for SSH, a protocol commonly targeted in brute force attacks, as attackers attempt to guess usernames and passwords.

#### 2. **Destination Port 51442**
- This is a high, seemingly random port. In brute force scenarios, especially in test or honeypot setups, attackers may connect from port 22 to a range of destination ports, mimicking login attempts.

#### 3. **Short Duration & Small Number of Packets**
- The flow is very short (0.012 seconds, 5 packets, 462 bytes). Brute force attacks typically consist of many short-lived connections as the attacker tries various credentials quickly.

#### 4. **TCP Flags: .AP..F**
- This expands to **ACK, PSH, FIN**. These flags suggest a quick data transfer followed by a termination (FIN). This is common in brute force tools/scripts that rapidly send login attempts and close connections after each try.

#### 5. **Not a “dos”, “portScan”, or “pingScan”**
- **DoS**: Would expect many more packets/bytes, and likely targeting a service port, not a high random port.
- **PortScan**: Would see many destination ports in parallel, not just a single flow.
- **PingScan**: Would use ICMP, not TCP.

#### 6. **Why not ""Normal""?**
- Normal SSH flows usually don't originate **from** port 22; rather, they **go to** port 22 (SSH is a server listening on port 22, not a client).
- Such a flow pattern (source port 22 to high-numbered destination port, short duration, rapid close) is not typical of normal user behavior.

---

### **Summary of Classification:**

This flow is most likely classified as **""bruteForce""** because:

- It uses TCP with source port 22 (SSH), which is atypical for normal user behavior but common in automated brute force attacks.
- The flow is very short-lived with a small number of packets, matching the profile of a brute force tool rapidly trying logins.
- The TCP flags suggest a quick data push and close, not a sustained session.
- The behavior does not fit ""normal"", ""dos"", ""portScan"", or ""pingScan"".

---

## **Conclusion**
**This flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because it matches the signature of a brute force SSH attack: short, repeated connections originating from port 22, likely attempting rapid login attempts.**


Explanation: 7

Let's analyze your network flow:

**Attributes:**
- **Start time**: 2017-03-20 11:15:00.915
- **Duration**: 0.0 seconds
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Src IP**: 192.168.220.16
- **Src port**: 59405
- **Dest IP**: 192.168.200.8
- **Dest port**: 22 (SSH)
- **Packets**: 1
- **Bytes**: 74
- **Flags**: ....S.

**Classification**: *bruteForce*

---

## Step-by-step Analysis

### 1. **Single SYN Packet**
The TCP flag **....S.** means only the SYN flag is set (others are off). This packet is the initial step of the TCP handshake, indicating an attempt to start a connection.

### 2. **Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
Port 22 is used for **SSH**, a common target for brute-force attacks, where attackers repeatedly try login credentials.

### 3. **Flow Duration and Size**
- **Duration is 0.0 seconds**: This means that the flow was extremely short, probably only a single packet (as indicated above).
- **Packets**: Only 1 packet sent.
- **Bytes**: 74 (typical size for a TCP SYN packet).

### 4. **Attack Label Options**
Let’s consider why it was labeled as *bruteForce* and not something else:

- **No attack** (""---""): This is a normal connection attempt. However, labeling as bruteForce suggests the context or pattern is malicious.
- **DoS**: Would involve a large number of packets/bytes or repeated attempts to disrupt service, which isn’t shown here.
- **PortScan**: Would involve attempts to connect to **many different ports** on the same host.
- **PingScan**: Would involve the ICMP protocol (not TCP), typically with many ICMP Echo Requests.
- **BruteForce**: Involves repeated connection attempts to *login services* (like SSH/port 22), possibly with many failed attempts.

### 5. **Why BruteForce?**
**In isolation, a single SYN packet to port 22 could be normal.**  
However, in attack detection, **brute-force attacks** on SSH are usually identified by **many such flows from the same source, with each flow representing an attempt to connect and log in**. Most network flow-based classifiers operate on aggregated data: if they see a pattern of many connection attempts to port 22 in a short time, especially from the same source IP, they flag all those flows (even the single-packet SYN flows) as part of a brute-force attack.

**Therefore, this flow was likely labeled ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It is a TCP SYN to port 22 (SSH).
- It is part of a pattern (in the dataset) of many such attempts from the same source IP to the same destination IP/port.
- The classifier marks all such flows as part of the brute-force activity.

### 6. **Summary Table**

| Reason                                    | Explanation                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Destination port is SSH (22)               | Brute-force attacks commonly target SSH                          |
| TCP SYN flag only                          | Start of a new connection attempt                                |
| Flow is very short (1 packet, 0 duration)  | Typical of repeated failed connection attempts in brute-force    |
| Likely part of a repeated pattern          | Classifier marks all such flows as brute-force in attack context |

---

## **Final Explanation**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it represents an attempt to initiate a TCP connection to SSH (port 22), and is part of a pattern of repeated connection attempts (likely from the same source IP) characteristic of an SSH brute-force attack, where attackers try to guess login credentials by making multiple rapid connections. The classifier marks even single SYN packets to SSH as brute-force when seen in such contexts.**


Explanation: 8

Let's break down the network flow attributes and analyze **why it was classified as ""bruteForce""**:

---

### **Flow Details**

- **Start time**: 2017-03-20 12:15:38.027  
- **Duration**: 0.132 seconds  
- **Protocol**: TCP  
- **Source IP**: 192.168.220.16  
- **Source port**: 60979  
- **Destination IP**: 192.168.100.6  
- **Destination port**: 22.0 (**SSH**)  
- **Packets**: 12  
- **Bytes**: 3115  
- **TCP Flags**: .AP.S.

---

### **Analysis**

#### **1. Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
- **Port 22** is the default port for **SSH (Secure Shell)**, a protocol typically used for secure remote login to servers.
- SSH is often targeted by attackers using **brute force attacks**: repeatedly trying different username/password combinations to gain unauthorized access.

#### **2. Number of Packets and Bytes**
- In a very short duration (**0.132 seconds**), **12 packets** and **3115 bytes** were exchanged.
- This is a relatively high number of packets for a single, short-lived connection, suggesting multiple authentication attempts rather than a single login.

#### **3. TCP Flags: "".AP.S.""**
- **A**CK, **P**SH, **S**YN are present.
- **SYN** flag indicates connection initiation.
- **PSH** and **ACK** are used for data transfer (possibly for sending credentials).
- The flags suggest an **active connection** where data is being pushed and acknowledged, as you might expect during rapid authentication attempts.

#### **4. Short Duration**
- The flow is **very short (0.132s)**, suggesting **rapid sequential attempts**—a hallmark of automated brute force tools.

#### **5. Not Consistent with Other Attack Types**
- **DoS** would typically involve a much higher number of packets and would target service availability, not SSH specifically.
- **PortScan** and **PingScan** would involve connections to **multiple ports or hosts**, not just port 22 on a single host.
- **Normal flow** would typically have fewer packets and bytes for a single connection, and would not exhibit rapid, repeated connections.

---

### **Conclusion**

**Why ""bruteForce""?**

> The flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it represents a rapid, automated attempt to access SSH (port 22) with multiple packets and data exchanges in a very short time, consistent with the behavior of brute force attack tools trying to guess SSH credentials. The combination of destination port, packet count, duration, and flag usage matches the signature of brute force attacks and not normal or other attack types.

**Summary Table:**

| Attribute           | Value                | Brute Force Indicator? |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Dest Port           | 22 (SSH)            | Yes                    |
| Packets             | 12                   | Yes (high for 0.13s)   |
| Duration            | 0.132s               | Yes (short, rapid)     |
| Flags               | .AP.S.               | Yes (active, data sent)|
| Bytes               | 3115                 | Yes (data exchanged)   |

---

**In short:**  
> **This flow looks like a brute force SSH login attempt due to the rapid, repeated packet exchange on port 22.**


Explanation: 9

Let's break down the **network flow** and the reasoning behind its classification as ""**bruteForce**"":

---

### **Flow Details**

- **Start time:** 2017-03-21 13:23:02.749
- **Duration:** 2.079 seconds
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source port:** 44937
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.4
- **Destination port:** 22.0 (**SSH**)
- **Packets:** 17
- **Bytes:** 3725
- **TCP Flags:** .AP.SF

---

### **Step-by-Step Reasoning**

1. **Destination Port = 22 (SSH):**
   - Port 22 is almost always used for **SSH** (Secure Shell) connections, which can be a target for brute force attacks (i.e., repeated attempts to guess username/password).

2. **Number of Packets & Bytes:**
   - 17 packets and 3725 bytes over ~2 seconds is consistent with a short burst of connection attempts, rather than a sustained data transfer (e.g., normal SSH session, file transfer, etc.).

3. **TCP Flags: "".AP.SF""**
   - This represents a **sequence of TCP flags** seen during the flow:
     - **A**: ACK (Acknowledgement)
     - **P**: PSH (Push)
     - **S**: SYN (Synchronize - used to initiate connections)
     - **F**: FIN (Finish - used to close connections)
   - The presence of **SYN** and **FIN** flags, along with **ACK/PSH**, suggests connection attempts and terminations, typical of repeated login tries.
   - The absence of **R** (RST - Reset) may indicate that connections are being closed gracefully, not forcibly reset.

4. **No Indication of PortScan or PingScan:**
   - **PortScan** would involve multiple destination ports, but here only port 22 is contacted.
   - **PingScan** would use ICMP, but this is TCP.

5. **No Indication of DoS:**
   - The traffic rate (packets, bytes, duration) is **not high enough** to indicate an attempt to overwhelm the server (which would typically involve many more packets/bytes, possibly to many ports).

6. **BruteForce Attack Characteristics:**
   - **Brute force attacks on SSH** involve repeatedly attempting to authenticate (with different passwords) over short periods.
   - The observed pattern — short duration, moderate number of packets, only port 22, TCP flags indicating repeated connection attempts — matches this behavior.

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | Brute Force Indicator? | Reason                                                        |
|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dest port = 22    | Yes                   | SSH login target                                              |
| Protocol = TCP    | Yes                   | SSH uses TCP                                                  |
| Multiple packets  | Yes                   | Multiple login attempts                                       |
| SYN/FIN flags     | Yes                   | Connection attempts and closures                              |
| Small duration    | Yes                   | Rapid attempt burst (not a long session)                      |
| Not DoS/Scan      | Yes                   | Not enough volume/ports for DoS or scan                       |

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**

- It targets the SSH port (22), commonly attacked via brute force.
- The number and pattern of packets, and the TCP flags, are consistent with repeated login attempts over a short period.
- There's no evidence of port scanning, ping scanning, or denial of service.

**In summary:**  
*A short, repeated attempt to connect to SSH with connection initiation and termination is a classic pattern for brute force attacks, which is why this flow was classified as ""bruteForce"".*


Explanation: 10

Let’s analyze the flow and why it was classified as **""bruteForce""**:

### Flow Attributes Breakdown

- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 36518  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.4  
- **Dest port:** 22.0 (SSH)  
- **Packets:** 5  
- **Bytes:** 610  
- **Flags:** .AP..F  
- **Duration:** 0.007 seconds  

### Key Points for Classification

1. **Destination Port is 22 (SSH):**
   - Port 22 is used for SSH, which is a common target for brute force attacks (attackers try multiple username/password combinations to gain access).

2. **Flow Duration is Very Short (0.007 seconds):**
   - This suggests a rapid sequence of packets, typical of automated attack tools.

3. **Number of Packets and Bytes:**
   - 5 packets and 610 bytes is a small exchange, consistent with an attempted but likely unsuccessful login or a script rapidly trying credentials.

4. **TCP Flags: `.AP..F`:**
   - This sequence indicates the following:
     - **A (ACK)**: Acknowledgement
     - **P (PSH)**: Push, indicating data is being sent (likely a login attempt)
     - **F (FIN)**: Finish flag, closing the connection
   - The absence of SYN at the start (would usually be S if the connection is being established) suggests this is not the very first packet, but rather a mid-connection exchange, possibly after some handshake.

5. **SSH Brute Force Behavior:**
   - Brute force attacks on SSH involve rapidly sending many connection attempts with different credentials in a short period.
   - Each attempt may be a short flow, like this one, quickly opening and closing the connection.

### Why Not Other Attacks?

- **""dos"" (Denial of Service):**
  - Would expect a high number of packets/bytes and often to a non-authentication service or a flood of connections.
- **""portScan"":**
  - Would see connections to many different ports, not just 22.
- **""pingScan"":**
  - Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **""---"" (Normal):**
  - Normal SSH flows would typically be longer and involve more data exchange, especially after successful login.

### **Summary Reasoning**

This flow is classified as **""bruteForce""** because:

- It targets SSH (port 22), a common brute force target.
- The flow is very short (rapid open/close), matching the pattern of automated brute force tools.
- The data likely represents an attempted login (PSH/ACK), followed by FIN to close.
- The flow attributes do not match the patterns of DoS, port scan, or ping scan attacks.

**In short:**  
**Repeated, rapid, short-lived connection attempts to SSH are a hallmark of brute force attacks, which fits the observed flow.**


Explanation: 11

Let's analyze the provided network flow and the possible labels:

### Flow Attributes:
- **Start time**: 2017-03-21 13:24:11.543
- **Duration**: 1.875 seconds
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Source IP**: 192.168.200.4
- **Source Port**: 22
- **Destination IP**: 192.168.220.16
- **Destination Port**: 45214
- **Packets**: 16
- **Bytes**: 2547
- **Flags**: .AP.SF

---

### Step-by-step reasoning:

#### 1. **Source and Destination Ports**
- **Source Port 22**: This is the standard port for **SSH** (Secure Shell), a common target for brute-force password attacks.
- **Destination Port 45214**: High numbered, likely a random ephemeral port used by the connecting client.

#### 2. **TCP Flags: `.AP.SF`**
- **A** (ACK), **P** (PSH), **S** (SYN), **F** (FIN)
- The concatenation is not a standard flag sequence but suggests a flow with established connection (SYN, ACK), data transfer (PSH), and termination (FIN).
- There is **no RST** (reset), so the connection was not abruptly closed.

#### 3. **Packets & Duration**
- **16 packets** and **2547 bytes** over **1.875 seconds**.
- For a single SSH session, this is a small amount of data, possibly indicating a failed authentication attempt or a quickly closed connection.

#### 4. **Attack Labels Analysis**
- **""---"" (Normal)**: If this were a normal SSH usage, you might expect a longer connection and more data.
- **""dos"" (Denial of Service)**: Usually characterized by a large number of connections or data in a short time, or many packets to overwhelm the server. That's not indicated here.
- **""portScan"" / ""pingScan""**: Would involve connections to many ports or using ICMP, respectively. This flow is only for port 22.
- **""bruteForce""**: Brute force attacks on SSH involve repeated connection attempts to port 22, often with multiple password guesses per connection.

#### 5. **Why ""bruteForce""?**
- **SSH port**: The use of port 22 strongly suggests SSH activity.
- **Short Duration, Small Data**: The connection is short and doesn't transfer much data, consistent with failed login attempts.
- **Multiple Packets**: 16 packets is enough for several authentication attempts within a single TCP connection (SSH allows multiple attempts per session), or for several quick connections in rapid succession.
- **No port scanning**: Only one destination port (22) is used, so not a port scan.
- **No DDoS pattern**: The connection is not high volume.
- **No ICMP**: So not a ping scan.

| Dest Port           | 45214                  | Client ephemeral port (not relevant to attack type)    |
| Flow Pattern        | Single host/port focus | Consistent with brute force, not scan or DoS           |

---

## **Final Explanation**

**This network flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a short-lived TCP connection to the SSH port (22) with a small number of packets and bytes, indicating attempted logins rather than normal interactive SSH use. Such patterns are typical for SSH brute force attacks, where an attacker tries to guess passwords repeatedly, often resulting in many short, low-data connections to port 22. The flow is not characteristic of a port scan, ping scan, or denial of service attack.**


Explanation: 12

Let's break down the information in your network flow, and analyze **why it might have been classified as ""bruteForce""**, even though, at first glance, it might not seem obvious.

---
### Flow Attributes

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-20 10:39:33.177  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source port:** 36858  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8  
- **Destination port:** 22.0 (**SSH**)  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 74  
- **TCP Flags:** ....S. (Only SYN flag is set)

---

## Step-by-step Analysis

### 1. **Type of Flow**
- **Only SYN flag set**: This means this flow is an **initial attempt to establish a TCP connection** (the first step in the TCP handshake).
- **Destination port 22:** This is the default port for **SSH** (Secure Shell), a common target for brute force password attacks.

### 2. **Single Packet**
- Only one packet (SYN) was seen, duration is 0.0 seconds.

### 3. **No Data Transfer**
- No ACK, no PSH, no further flags: just a SYN packet.

---

## Why ""bruteForce""?

A **brute force attack** on SSH typically looks like this:
- An attacker tries to connect to the SSH port (22) repeatedly, often with many different usernames/passwords.
- Each connection attempt typically starts with a TCP SYN packet to port 22.

However, **this single flow alone does not provide enough context** (such as multiple repeated attempts) to be certain of a brute force attack. But in **many intrusion detection datasets and flow-based analysis systems**, **ANY SYN attempt to an authentication service (like SSH) from an unusual source is sometimes pre-labeled as ""bruteForce""** for training purposes, especially if:
- It is part of a sequence of SYNs from the same source to port 22;
- The labeling system is conservative (to capture all suspicious login attempts);
- Context from other flows (not shown here) is used for labeling (i.e., this is one of many similar flows).

### **Why not another label?**
- **dos:** Denial of service normally involves lots of packets, possibly to many ports or the same port, often with high packet/byte counts.
- **portScan:** Typically involves SYNs to MANY different ports (here, only port 22).
- **pingScan:** Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **Normal:** If this is a legitimate user starting an SSH session, it would be normal. But if the labeling system is *context-agnostic*, it may err on the side of caution.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | Value          | Implication                                                   |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dest Port         | 22 (SSH)      | Potential login/service attempt                               |
| TCP Flags         | SYN           | Start of connection attempt                                   |
| Packets           | 1             | Only a single attempt (as seen in this flow)                  |
| Labeled as        | bruteForce    | Likely due to SYN to SSH port (possibly as part of a pattern) |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" likely because it is a SYN attempt to the SSH port (22), which is a common target for brute-force password guessing attacks.** Even though this single flow alone doesn't show repeated attempts, the labeling may be based on detection rules or context (like many such flows in a short period), or simply because any SYN to SSH from certain IPs is flagged as brute force in the dataset. 

If you only have this flow, the classification is likely a precaution or based on broader context not included in the single record.

---

**If you have more flows from the same source to port 22 in a short time, that would further support the brute force classification.**


Explanation: 13

Let's break down the details of your flow:

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:48:41.088  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source port:** 39770  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8  
- **Destination port:** 22 (SSH)  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 74  
- **Flags:** ....S. (only SYN flag set)  

### What does this flow represent?

- **TCP SYN to port 22:** This is an attempt to initiate a TCP connection to the SSH port (22) on 192.168.200.8.
- **Only one packet, SYN flag:** This specific flow is just the initial connection request (SYN) and doesn't show further communication.

### Why classify this as ""bruteForce""?

#### 1. **Context:**
A single flow like this, on its own, is not enough to definitively label as ""bruteForce"". However, in network flow-based intrusion detection, **brute-force SSH attacks** are often identified by observing multiple rapid connection attempts (usually lots of SYN packets) to port 22 from the same source or from many sources in a short period of time.

#### 2. **Heuristics:**
- **Port 22:** This is the standard SSH port, which is a common target for brute-force attacks.
- **SYN packet:** Attackers usually start brute-force attacks by sending many SYN packets to initiate connections.
- **Flow-level view:** Flow-based IDS may flag *each* attempted connection to port 22 as ""bruteForce"" if it matches patterns seen in brute-force attacks (many short-duration, single-packet SYN flows).

#### 3. **Why not other labels?**
- **""dos"":** DOS attacks typically involve many packets, often to a variety of ports or protocols, with the goal of overwhelming the target. One SYN packet doesn’t fit this.
- **""portScan"":** A port scan usually involves SYN packets to *many* different ports on the target, not just port 22.
- **""pingScan"":** This would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **""---"":** If there was no attack, it would be normal; but a flow to port 22 with a SYN flag can be suspicious in some detection policies.

### **Summary Table**

| Feature        | Value         | Relevance to ""bruteForce"" |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Protocol       | TCP          | SSH uses TCP              |
| Dest port      | 22           | SSH, common brute-force target |
| Flags          | SYN          | Start of connection, typical for brute-force attempts |
| Packets        | 1            | Many brute-force attempts are only SYN packets (blocked by server) |
| Duration       | 0.0          | Connection not established (likely rejected), fits brute-force pattern |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was likely classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It is a TCP SYN packet to port 22 (SSH), which is a typical method for beginning a brute-force attack on SSH services.
- Flow-based IDS systems often flag *all* initial connection attempts to SSH during an attack window as ""bruteForce"", even if a single flow just contains a SYN packet.
- The context may include other similar flows, but even in isolation, this pattern is *characteristic* of brute-force attempts in automated detection systems.

**If you have a large number of such flows from the same source or in a short time-frame, this further reinforces the brute-force classification.**

---

**If you want to be more precise:**
- This flow *alone* is not sufficient evidence of brute-force, but it matches the pattern usually seen in brute-force attacks and is thus classified as such by automated systems.

---

### **Step-by-step Reasoning**

#### 1. **Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
- Port 22 is used for **SSH (Secure Shell)**, commonly targeted for unauthorized access attempts via username/password guessing (brute force).

#### 2. **Transport Protocol: TCP**
- SSH runs over TCP, consistent with this flow.

#### 3. **Moderate Packet and Byte Count**
- **17 packets** and **3725 bytes** over **1.45 seconds**—a short burst of traffic, possibly several authentication attempts in a short period.

#### 4. **TCP Flags: `.AP.SF`**
- Concatenated sequence of flags seen in the flow:
    - **A** - ACK (acknowledge)
    - **P** - PSH (push)
    - **S** - SYN (synchronize)
    - **F** - FIN (finish)
- The presence of **SYN** at the beginning, and **FIN** at the end, is consistent with starting and ending a connection.
- The presence of **PSH** and **ACK** indicates data transfer (e.g., sending credentials, receiving responses).

#### 5. **Brute Force Characteristics**
- **Brute force attacks** on SSH typically involve:
    - Multiple rapid connection attempts.
    - Short-lived sessions (often disconnected after failed login).
    - Several small data packets (authentication payloads).
    - Source IP may try to connect repeatedly to port 22.

#### 6. **Why not another label?**
- **""dos""**: Would usually show a much higher packet count/byte count, often against various ports or with abnormal flag patterns.
- **""portScan""**/**""pingScan""**: Would target multiple ports or use ICMP, not just a single SSH port.
- **""---""**: Normal SSH flows typically have more sustained data transfer and don’t show so many short-lived connections per second.

---

### **Summary Explanation**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- The destination port is SSH (22), a common brute force target.
- The flow duration is short, with a moderate number of packets, typical of failed login attempts.
- TCP flags suggest a full connection attempt with data transfer (likely login data), then connection closure.
- Such patterns are consistent with automated tools trying to guess SSH credentials in quick succession.

**In essence:**  
*The flow matches the behavioral pattern of an SSH brute force attack: repeated, rapid login attempts to port 22, moderate packets in a short burst, and connection closures—all typical of brute force attempts.*


Explanation: 15

Let's analyze the provided network flow and the likely reasoning for a ""bruteForce"" classification.

---

### Flow Attributes

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-21 13:22:20.028  
- **Duration:** 0.16 seconds  
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.200.4  
- **Src port:** 22  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Dest port:** 44781  
- **Packets:** 11  
- **Bytes:** 2085  
- **Flags:** `.AP.S.`

---

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. **Source Port 22**
- Port 22 is **SSH** (Secure Shell), which is commonly targeted by brute force attacks because attackers often try to guess user credentials on SSH servers.

#### 2. **High Number of Packets in Short Duration**
- **11 packets** and **2085 bytes** transferred in just **0.16 seconds** is unusually high for a single connection, especially to SSH.
- This could indicate multiple authentication attempts in a very short time.

#### 3. **Destination Port is High**
- Destination port **44781** is a high, likely ephemeral port. This suggests the client (192.168.220.16) initiated the connection to the server's SSH port (22).
    - This is typical for SSH client connections.

#### 4. **TCP Flags: `.AP.S.`**
- The TCP flags sequence includes `A` (ACK), `P` (PSH), and `S` (SYN).
    - The presence of both `SYN` and `ACK/PSH` flags in a single flow can indicate rapid connection setups and data transmissions, consistent with brute force tools that repeatedly connect and send authentication attempts.
    - The absence of `F` (FIN) and `R` (RST) can mean the connection was not closed gracefully—again, common with automated attack tools.

#### 5. **No Signs of Port Scanning or DoS**
- **Port Scanning** typically targets many different ports in quick succession, but this flow is only to port 22.
- **DoS** attacks usually involve many more packets and bytes, often with abnormal flags or connection patterns.
- **Ping Scan** uses ICMP, not TCP.

#### 6. **Not a Normal Flow**
- Normal SSH usage would likely have fewer packets and bytes in such a short time and would not exhibit rapid connection and data attempts as seen here.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | Normal Flow | Brute Force | This Flow      |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Port 22           | Possible    | Very likely | Yes           |
| Short Duration    | Yes         | Yes         | Yes (0.16s)   |
| Packets           | Low-medium  | High        | 11            |
| Bytes             | Low-medium  | High        | 2085          |
| TCP Flags         | Normal      | Aggressive  | .AP.S.        |
| Many Dest Ports   | No          | No          | No            |
| Many Src Ports    | No          | No          | No            |

---

## **Conclusion: Why ""bruteForce""?**

- **SSH port** is being targeted, which is a common vector for brute force attacks.
- **High packet and byte count** in a **very short duration** suggests rapid, repeated attempts (e.g., trying many passwords quickly).
- **TCP Flags** show aggressive connection and data transmission behavior.
- **No evidence** of port scan, ping scan, or DoS patterns.

**Therefore, the flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it matches typical patterns of SSH brute force attacks: rapid, repeated access attempts to the SSH port in a short time with aggressive connection behavior.**

- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-21 13:20:15.665
- **Duration:** 0.007 seconds
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.200.4
- **Src port:** 22 _(SSH)_
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Dest port:** 44722
- **Packets:** 5

---

### Why was it classified as ""bruteForce""?

#### 1. **Source Port is 22 (SSH)**
- TCP port 22 is **the standard port for SSH** (Secure Shell).
- Brute force attacks are very common against SSH services, where an attacker tries many username/password combinations in a short time.

#### 2. **Short Duration, Small Number of Packets**
- The flow lasted **0.007 seconds** and involved **5 packets**.
- Brute force attacks often involve a series of short, rapid connection attempts as the attacker tries to guess the password.

#### 3. **TCP Flags: .AP..F (ACK, PSH, FIN)**
- These flags indicate a typical end of a TCP conversation, possibly after a data transfer.
- In brute force SSH attempts, the attacker tries to log in, the server responds, and the connection is closed quickly when the login fails.

#### 4. **Destination Port is High (>1024)**
- The destination port is 44722, which is a high ephemeral port. This suggests it could be a response from the SSH server to a client that initiated the connection from port 22 (which is unusual in normal client-server relationships, but sometimes observed in attack traffic or misconfigured hosts).

#### 5. **Common Patterns in Brute Force Flows**
- Many brute force detection systems look for:
  - Many short-lived connections to SSH (port 22),
  - Repeated login attempts,
  - Unusual source/destination port usage.
- The presence of a flow from port 22 to a high-numbered port, in a short burst, fits the pattern of a brute force attempt, possibly as part of a scanning tool or automated script.

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | Typical Brute Force Indicator                       |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Src Port: 22      | SSH service targeted                               |
| Short Duration    | Many rapid connection attempts                     |
| Few Packets/Bytes | Failed logins or quick disconnects                 |
| TCP Flags: .AP..F | Normal closure after failed attempt                |

---

### **Conclusion**

This flow was likely classified as **""bruteForce""** because:
- It involves the SSH port (22), a frequent brute force target.
- The connection was very short, with few packets and bytes, matching the rapid, failed login attempts typical in brute force attacks.
- The TCP flags indicate a normal connection closure, likely after a failed login.
- The pattern fits automated tools used in brute force attacks, which establish many short-lived connections in a short period.

**If you saw many such flows from the same source in a short time, it would be almost certain brute force activity.**


Explanation: 17

Let's analyze the flow and its classification:

### Flow Attributes

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:40:35.738  
- **Duration:** 0.0 s  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source port:** 37046  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8  
- **Destination port:** 22 (SSH)  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 74  
- **Flags:** ....S. (only SYN flag set)

### Classification: **""bruteForce""**

#### What is a Brute Force Attack?
A brute force attack on SSH (port 22) typically involves repeatedly and rapidly attempting to authenticate using different passwords or usernames in order to gain unauthorized access.

#### Flow Analysis

- **Single SYN packet:** This flow consists of a single TCP SYN packet (the start of a TCP connection).
- **Destination port 22:** The SYN packet is directed at port 22, the default port for SSH services, which is a common target of brute force attacks.
- **No further packets:** Since the duration is 0 and only 1 packet was transmitted, this flow only represents a connection attempt (SYN), not a completed handshake or data transfer.

#### Why was it classified as ""bruteForce""?

**Normally, a single SYN packet to port 22 would not, by itself, be enough evidence for brute force.**  
However, in many network flow labeling systems, if there are many such flows from the same source IP to port 22 in a short time, each individual SYN packet may be labeled as ""bruteForce"" as part of a larger brute force campaign. The logic is that:

- Attackers performing SSH brute force attacks typically open many connections in rapid succession, sending SYN packets to port 22.
- Flow-based classifiers may lack packet-level context, so they label all such connection attempts as ""bruteForce"" if they occur during a known brute force window.
- The label might be applied to **all** flows from a source to port 22 during the attack period, even if an individual flow is just a single SYN packet.

#### Summary Table

| Attribute         | Value             | Brute Force Reasoning            |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Protocol          | TCP              | SSH uses TCP                     |
| Destination Port  | 22               | Default SSH port (attack target) |
| TCP Flags         | SYN              | Start of connection              |
| Packets           | 1                | Rapid, repeated attempts         |
| Duration          | 0                | Likely part of rapid attempts    |

**Conclusion:**  
This flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" **not because of its individual behavior, but because it fits the pattern of traffic generated during an SSH brute force attack: repeated SYNs to port 22.** In datasets or labeling schemes, every connection attempt in such a window is labeled as ""bruteForce"", even if, on its own, each flow could also resemble a port scan or a normal connection attempt.

If you have a dataset or labeling context, it's common for all connection-attempt flows to SSH during an identified attack timeframe to be labeled as ""bruteForce"" to simplify detection.


Explanation: 18

Let's break down your flow attributes and classification:

**Flow Attributes:**
- **Start Time:** 2017-03-20 10:47:38.749  
- **Duration:** 0.997 seconds  
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src Port:** 39702  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.8  
- **Dest Port:** 22 (SSH)  
- **Packets:** 2  
- **Bytes:** 148  
- **Flags:** ....S. (Only SYN flag is set)  

**Classification:** ""bruteForce""

---

### Analysis

#### 1. **Destination Port 22**
- Port 22 is typically used for SSH (Secure Shell), which is often targeted during brute-force attacks as attackers attempt to guess SSH login credentials.

#### 2. **TCP SYN Flag (....S.)**
- The flow only has the SYN flag set, which means this flow is a connection initiation attempt, not a completed connection (no ACK, no data transfer).  
- Two packets, 148 bytes: Typically, a single SYN packet is sent; the second packet could be a retransmission or a SYN-ACK reply, but with only SYN in flags, it likely indicates two SYN attempts.

#### 3. **Short Duration, Small Packet/Byte Count**
- The flow lasted approximately 1 second, with very little data transferred. This is typical for repeated login attempts or scanning, where connections are attempted and then dropped if unsuccessful.

#### 4. **Why ""bruteForce""?**
- **Brute-force SSH attacks** involve repeatedly trying to connect to port 22 using different username/password combinations.  
- In many datasets, a single flow like this—especially targeting port 22 with SYN packets—can be labeled as part of a brute-force attack, **especially if it is part of a larger pattern** (i.e., many similar flows from the same source to the same destination in a short period).
- The classifier likely labeled this as ""bruteForce"" because:
  - It is a connection attempt to SSH (port 22).
  - The pattern (SYN packets only, multiple attempts in short time) matches the signature of brute-force login attempts.

#### 5. **Why Not Other Attacks?**
- **DoS:** Usually involves high packet/byte counts and attempts to overwhelm the server. This flow is small.
- **PortScan:** Would involve SYN packets but typically to *many* destination ports, not just port 22.
- **PingScan:** Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **Normal (""---""):** Ordinary SSH sessions would show completed TCP handshakes, more packets, and data transfer.

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute                  | Value                   | Indicative of BruteForce? |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Destination Port           | 22 (SSH)                | Yes                       |
| TCP Flags                  | SYN only                | Yes                       |
| Packets/Bytes              | 2 / 148                 | Consistent                |
| Duration                   | 0.997s                  | Consistent                |
| Multiple attempts (if part of a pattern) | Possible         | Yes                       |

### **Conclusion**

**The flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a connection attempt (SYN flag) to the SSH port (22), which is a common target for brute-force login attacks. The pattern of small, short-lived flows with only SYN packets to SSH ports is a typical signature of brute-force attempts—even for single flows, classifiers may label this as ""bruteForce"" based on known attack patterns.**

---

**If you have more flows from the same source to port 22 in a short period, this is even stronger evidence of brute-force behavior.**


Explanation: 19

Let's analyze your network flow attributes and the classification:

**Flow Details:**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:26:15.984
- **Duration:** 0.999 seconds
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source port:** 34353
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Destination port:** 22.0 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 2
- **Bytes:** 148
- **Flags:** ....S. (only the SYN flag set)

**Label:** `""bruteForce""`

---

## Why was this flow classified as ""bruteForce""?

### 1. **Destination Port 22**
- Port 22 is the default port for SSH (Secure Shell), which is a common target for brute-force attacks as attackers often try to guess SSH login credentials.

### 2. **SYN Flag Only**
- The TCP flags field is **....S.**, meaning only the SYN flag is set. This indicates the start of a new TCP connection attempt.
- If you have many flows like this (SYN packets to port 22), it suggests repeated attempts to initiate connections to the SSH service.

### 3. **Low Packet and Byte Count**
- Only 2 packets and 148 bytes were transmitted. This is typical for connection attempts that do not complete the handshake (i.e., the server may not respond, or the connection is reset quickly).

### 4. **Brute-force SSH Attack Pattern**
- **Brute-force attacks** on SSH typically involve many connection attempts from a single source (or a few sources) to port 22, trying different username/password combinations.
- Even if this flow alone doesn't show multiple attempts, systems often label such flows as ""bruteForce"" if they match a pattern observed in a batch of flows (e.g., many SYNs to port 22 from the same source).

### 5. **Difference from Other Attacks**
- **PortScan:** Would involve SYNs to many different ports, not just port 22.
- **DoS:** Would involve a much higher packet/byte count or many simultaneous flows to overwhelm the target.
- **PingScan:** Would use ICMP, not TCP SYN to port 22.
- **Normal:** A normal SSH session would progress beyond just a SYN packet and would involve more packets/bytes and different flag combinations.

## **Summary Table**

| Feature         | Value               | Relevance to ""bruteForce""        |
|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Dest port       | 22 (SSH)           | Common brute-force target        |
| TCP Flags       | SYN only           | Indicates connection attempts    |
| Packet/Byte cnt | Low (2/148)        | Typical for uncompleted handshakes |
| Attack pattern  | (Implied) Many such flows | Matches brute-force signature |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it matches the pattern of repeated connection attempts (SYN packets) to the SSH port (22), which is characteristic of brute-force attacks where attackers try to guess SSH credentials. The flow’s attributes—SYN flag, destination port 22, and low packet/byte count—fit this pattern.**

If you have only this single flow, the context would be weak, but in IDS/IPS systems, such a flow is often classified as brute-force if it's part of a series of similar attempts.


Explanation: 20

Let's break down the given flow and analyze **why it might have been classified as ""bruteForce""**.

### Flow Attributes

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-20 10:56:30.782
- **Duration:** 1.002 seconds
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source Port:** 46528
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Destination Port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 2
- **Bytes:** 148
- **TCP Flags:** ....S.

### What does this flow represent?

- **TCP SYN Flag (....S.):**  
  The only flag present is **SYN**. This means the source is **initiating a TCP connection**—it's the first step in a connection handshake.

- **Packets/Bytes:**  
  Only **2 packets** and **148 bytes** were exchanged. For a normal SSH session, this is extremely small. Typically, a full SSH handshake and login attempt would involve more packets, especially if authentication is attempted.

- **Destination Port 22:**  
  This is the default port for **SSH**. SSH is a common target for brute-force password attacks.

### Why is this flow likely classified as ""bruteForce""?

- **Brute-force attacks** on SSH involve an attacker making repeated connection attempts to guess login credentials.  
- **Flow evidence matching brute-force pattern:**
  - **SYN packet(s) to port 22**: Indicates repeated attempts to initiate SSH connections.
  - **Very short flows (few packets, little data):** Each connection attempt is short, often because the attacker tries a password, gets rejected, and immediately tries again.
  - **Multiple flows from the same source to the same destination port (not shown in this single flow, but often the case):** Machine learning models often use patterns across multiple similar flows to classify brute-force attacks.

### Why *this* flow, specifically?

This single flow is a **TCP SYN** to port 22, but with only two packets and no further handshake completion. By itself, this could be part of a port scan or a single failed connection.

**However, if this flow is one of many similar flows** (e.g., many short-lived SYNs to port 22 from the same source), it fits the brute-force attack pattern:

- **Port scan** is usually characterized by SYNs to many different ports, not just port 22.
- **DoS** would involve many packets or much more data, often to overwhelm the service.
- **Ping scan** uses ICMP, not TCP.
- **Normal flow** would have more packets, and successful session establishment.

**So, it's likely that the classifier saw this flow (and others like it) as part of a series of rapid, repeated, short-lived connection attempts to SSH, which is indicative of brute-force attacks.**

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | Value                  | Brute-force relevance                                                         |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Protocol          | TCP                   | SSH runs over TCP, so brute-force attacks use TCP                             |
| Destination Port  | 22                    | SSH default port, frequent brute-force target                                 |
| TCP Flag          | SYN                   | Initiating connections (many SYNs to port 22 = brute-force pattern)           |
| Packets/Bytes     | 2 / 148               | Very short flow, consistent with failed or rejected login attempts            |
| Duration          | 1.002s                | Short-lived, as expected in rapid brute-force attempts                        |

---

## **Conclusion**

This flow was classified as **""bruteForce""** because:

- It is a TCP SYN to port 22 (SSH), a common brute-force target.
- The flow is short (2 packets, 148 bytes), suggesting a failed or rejected connection attempt.
- Brute-force attacks typically involve many such short, repeated attempts.

**If this flow is part of a pattern of repeated, rapid SYNs to port 22 from the same source, this is strong evidence of a brute-force SSH attack.**  
If this is an isolated flow, it might be misclassified, but classifiers often work on context and patterns over time, not just single flows.


Explanation: 21

Let's break down the flow attributes and why it was classified as **""bruteForce""**:

---

## 1. **Destination Port is 22 (SSH)**
- Port **22** is used by the **SSH** service, which is a common target for brute force attacks, as attackers try many username/password combinations to gain access.

## 2. **Duration: 1.721 seconds**
- The connection lasted almost 2 seconds. This is long enough to attempt multiple authentication tries, but not so long as to look like a normal long-lived session.

## 3. **Packets and Bytes**
- **16 packets** and **3659 bytes** exchanged during this period.
- For SSH, a normal login might involve fewer packets if successful, or many attempts in a short burst if brute forcing.

## 4. **TCP Flags: `.AP.SF`**
- **A** (ACK): Acknowledgement of received data.
- **P** (PSH): Push function, sending data to the application.
- **S** (SYN): Start of a connection.
- **F** (FIN): Finish (close) the connection.
- The combination suggests the connection was established, data was sent, and then closed—typical of a scripted automated process, as opposed to a long, interactive session.

## 5. **Source/Destination IPs and Ports**
- Source port is high (37192), typical for client-side ephemeral ports.
- The single destination port is 22, not a scan across many ports (rules out ""portScan"" or ""pingScan"").

## 6. **Why Not Other Attacks?**
- **DoS:** Would typically involve *many* packets, *many* bytes, and possibly multiple flows, often to overwhelm the service.
- **PortScan/PingScan:** Would involve many destination ports or ICMP packets, not just one port.
- **No Attack:** Normal flows to SSH typically involve fewer packets/bytes unless a real session is established, and would not have many short, failed connection attempts.

---

## **Why ""bruteForce""?**

- **Brute force attacks** on SSH involve rapid, repeated login attempts using different credentials, all to port 22.
- The flow’s attributes (short duration, data exchanged, flags, repeated attempts) match what one would see in an automated brute force SSH attempt: connect, send credentials, get rejected, disconnect, and repeat, all in quick succession.
- The relatively high number of packets for a short connection, and the fact that it’s to port 22, are strong indicators of this.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute        | Brute Force Pattern                               |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Dest Port = 22   | Targeting SSH for login attempts                 |
| Duration ~2 sec  | Multiple rapid login attempts                     |
| 16 packets       | More than a single failed login, but not a full session |
| Flags .AP.SF     | Data transmission (login attempts) and closure   |
| Not multiple ports | Not a scan                                      |

---

**Therefore, this flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it matches the pattern of an SSH brute force attack: repeated, short-lived connections to port 22, with a moderate number of packets and bytes, characteristic of automated login attempts.**


Explanation: 22

Let's break down the network flow attributes and see why it might have been classified as **""bruteForce""**:

---

**1. Protocol and Ports:**
- **Proto:** TCP
- **Src port:** 22  
    - **Port 22** is the default port for **SSH (Secure Shell)**, a common service that is targeted for brute-force login attempts.
- **Dest port:** 44715  
    - This high-numbered port is likely a random ephemeral port on the destination.

**2. IP Addresses:**
- **Src IP:** 192.168.200.4
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16  
    - Both are private addresses, suggesting internal network activity.

**3. Duration and Volume:**
- **Duration:** 0.158 seconds  
    - This is a short-lived connection.
- **Packets:** 11
- **Bytes:** 2085  
    - In a short time, a relatively large number of packets and bytes are exchanged, which could indicate rapid attempts to send information.

**4. TCP Flags:**
- **Flags:** .AP.S.
    - **A (ACK)**, **P (PSH)**, **S (SYN)**
    - The presence of **SYN** indicates the start of a connection.
    - **ACK** and **PSH** are used for data transfer.
    - The absence of **F (FIN)** or **R (RST)** suggests the connection may not have been closed gracefully.

---

## Why ""bruteForce""?

**Brute-force attacks** typically involve repeatedly trying different username/password combinations to gain unauthorized access to a service, most commonly SSH (port 22). Here’s why this flow likely fits that pattern:

1. **SSH (port 22) as Source:**  
   The flow originates from port 22, which is unusual. Normally, port 22 would be the destination when connecting to an SSH server. However, in some logging systems, the directionality might be flipped, or it could indicate an SSH server establishing an outbound connection (less common), or a reply in an existing SSH session.  
   More likely, this is an SSH-related flow.

2. **Short, Repeated Connection:**  
   Brute-force attacks often use many short-lived connections, each attempting a login. The short duration and moderate packet/byte count are consistent with an SSH login attempt.

3. **Flags Pattern:**  
   The use of **SYN** (start of connection), **ACK/PSH** (data transfer), and the absence of **FIN** or **RST** (no graceful closure) are consistent with failed or abruptly terminated login attempts, which often occur during brute-force attacks.

4. **Moderate Packets/Bytes:**  
   Brute-force attempts may not involve high data transfer (unlike DoS), but will show a pattern of many small sessions or packets within a short time frame.

5. **Exclusion of Other Attacks:**
   - **DoS:** Would usually show much higher packet/byte counts, longer duration, or repeated connections.
   - **PortScan:** Would involve connecting to *many* destination ports, not repeatedly to one (here, only one dest port is used).
   - **PingScan:** Would use ICMP, not TCP.
   - **No Attack:** The context (SSH, short-lived, moderate traffic) combined with known brute-force patterns makes ""no attack"" less likely.

| Attribute           | Value                           | BruteForce Reasoning                                   |

| **Duration**        | 0.158 sec                       | Typical of a single login attempt                      |
| **Packets/Bytes**   | 11 / 2085                       | Consistent with login attempt, not massive flood       |
| **Flags**           | .AP.S.                          | SYN/ACK/PSH, no graceful closure                       |

---

## **Conclusion**
**This flow is likely classified as ""bruteForce"" because it matches the typical pattern of an SSH login attempt, which is a common target for brute-force password guessing. The connection is short, involves port 22, and transmits a number of packets/bytes consistent with a login attempt, not a scan or denial-of-service attack.**

If you have more flows, you might notice a pattern of many such short SSH connections—this is often a clear indicator of brute-force activity.


Explanation: 23

Let's break down the flow attributes and see why it was **classified as ""bruteForce""**:

---

### **Flow Attributes**

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 12:39:24.027  
- **Duration:** 0.125 seconds
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 52239
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.100.4  
- **Dest port:** 22.0 (**SSH**)
- **Packets:** 13  
- **Bytes:** 3181  
- **Flags:** .AP.S.

---

### **Interpretation**

#### **1. Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
- **SSH** is a common target for brute force attacks, where attackers repeatedly try different username/password combinations to gain unauthorized access.

#### **2. Number of Packets and Bytes**
- **13 packets** and **3181 bytes** over **0.125 seconds** is a high rate for a single flow, suggesting rapid communication. This is consistent with automated login attempts rather than manual usage.

#### **3. TCP Flags**
- **.AP.S.**  (ACK, PSH, SYN)  
  - **SYN:** Indicates the initiation of a TCP connection.
  - **ACK + PSH:** Indicates data transfer, likely login attempts.
  - The absence of FIN or RST suggests the session was not closed gracefully, possibly cut off after a failed attempt.

#### **4. Source Port is High (>1024)**
- Indicates an ephemeral port, typical of a client machine initiating connections.

#### **5. Duration**
- Only **0.125 seconds**: This implies rapid, possibly automated, attempts.

---

### **Why Not Other Attack Types?**

- **dos (Denial of Service):**  
  - Usually characterized by a huge number of packets, often to exhaust resources, and not typically targeting SSH or using normal-sized sessions.

- **portScan:**  
  - Would involve attempts to many different destination ports, not just port 22.

- **pingScan:**  
  - Would use ICMP protocol, not TCP.

- **No Attack (---):**  
  - Legitimate SSH connections exist, but normal ones would not attempt so many rapid packets in so short a time, and would usually show a more normal flag pattern (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, etc.), not so much data so quickly.

---

### **Conclusion**

**This flow shows all the hallmarks of a brute force attack:**
- Targeting the SSH port (22)
- Rapid, repeated connections (high packet and byte count in short duration)
- Automated behavior (high frequency, not typical of human behavior)
- TCP flags suggest repeated connection attempts and data pushes

**Therefore, it is classified as ""bruteForce"".**


Explanation: 24

Let's break down the flow and classification:

### **Flow Attributes**

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 11:21:39.591  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source port:** 59421  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8  
- **Destination port:** 22.0 (SSH)  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 74  
- **Flags:** ....S. (SYN flag set, all others are unset)

### **Label Assigned:**  
**""bruteForce""**

---

## **Explanation of Classification**

### 1. **Understanding the Flow**
- **TCP SYN Packet:** The only TCP flag set is SYN (`....S.`). This means this flow represents the very first step of a TCP handshake — an attempt to initiate a connection.
- **Destination Port 22 (SSH):** Port 22 is used for SSH, which is a common target for brute force password attacks.
- **Only 1 Packet:** This flow records a single SYN packet, indicating a connection attempt, but not a completed handshake or data transfer.

### 2. **Why ""bruteForce""?**

- **Brute Force Attacks on SSH:**  
  Brute force attacks often target SSH by trying many username/password combinations. This involves repeatedly attempting to establish TCP connections to port 22 on a target host.
- **Characteristic Flow Pattern:**  
  - Brute force attacks are generally detected by observing **multiple SYN packets** (connection attempts) to port 22 from the same or different source IPs in a short period.
  - **Each individual connection attempt**, even if it is just a SYN packet, can be recorded as a separate flow.
- **Limited Information:**  
  - This specific flow is just a single SYN packet to port 22. Alone, this is indistinguishable from a normal SSH connection attempt.
  - However, if the classification system is labeling this as ""bruteForce,"" it's likely looking at the **context of multiple flows** (not just this one), or is being overly sensitive to any SYN packet directed at port 22.

### 3. **Why Not Other Labels?**
- **""---"" (Normal):**  
  A single SYN to port 22 could be normal, unless context shows repeated attempts.
- **""dos"":**  
  DOS attacks usually involve high volumes of traffic, often to many ports or services, not just port 22.
- **""portScan"":**  
  Port scans target **multiple ports** on a host, not a single SYN to a single port.
- **""pingScan"":**  
  Ping scans use ICMP packets, not TCP SYNs.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | Value         | Relevance to ""bruteForce"" Label                     |
|-------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Dest Port         | 22 (SSH)     | Common brute force target                           |
| TCP Flags         | SYN          | Indicates connection attempt                        |
| Packets           | 1            | One connection attempt                              |
| Contextual Flows* | Not shown    | Likely part of multiple similar flows in dataset    |

(*Actual brute force detection generally relies on seeing many such flows.)

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was likely classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a TCP SYN packet to port 22 (SSH), which is a common target for brute force attacks.** In most detection systems, a single SYN to port 22 is not enough for brute force, but if there are multiple such flows in a short time, the system may flag them all as brute force attempts. Alternatively, the classifier may be conservative and label any SSH connection attempt as ""bruteForce"" based on training data or heuristics.

If you have only this one flow, the classification is probably due to the destination port (SSH) and the presence of a connection attempt (SYN packet), which matches the signature of the **start of a brute force attack**. 

**However, in real-world detection, the context (multiple similar flows) is crucial for confirming brute force activity.**


Explanation: 25

Certainly! Let’s analyze your flow and explain **why it was classified as ""bruteForce""**.

### Flow Attributes Recap

| Attribute        | Value                    |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Start time       | 2017-03-20 12:38:11.542 |
| Duration         | 0.005 sec               |
| Protocol         | TCP                     |
| Src IP           | 192.168.220.16          |
| Src port         | 51783                   |
| Dest IP          | 192.168.100.4           |
| Dest port        | 22.0                    |
| Packets          | 5                       |
| Bytes            | 610                     |
| TCP Flags        | .AP..F                  |

---

## Step-by-Step Reasoning

### 1. **Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
- **Port 22** is the standard port for SSH (Secure Shell), which is commonly targeted by brute force attacks attempting to guess user credentials.

### 2. **Short Duration, Multiple Packets**
- The flow lasted only **0.005 seconds** but involved **5 packets** and **610 bytes** transmitted.
- In brute force attacks, multiple rapid connection attempts or login attempts can occur in quick succession.

### 3. **TCP Flags: `.AP..F`**
- **A** (ACK): Acknowledgment
- **P** (PSH): Push function (send data immediately)
- **F** (FIN): Finish (connection termination)
- The flags indicate that data was transmitted (`P`), the connection was acknowledged (`A`), and then closed (`F`). This pattern is common in short, repeated authentication attempts.

### 4. **Source and Destination IPs**
- The traffic is from an internal source IP to another internal IP, possibly indicating an insider or a compromised host attempting to brute-force login.

### 5. **Number of Packets and Bytes**
- The number of packets (5) and the amount of data (610 bytes) is consistent with a small number of SSH authentication attempts (each SSH login attempt involves the exchange of several packets).

---

## **Why Not Other Labels?**

- **""dos"" (Denial of Service):** Usually involves a very large number of packets or bytes in a very short time, often to overwhelm the service. This flow is too small and short for that.
- **""portScan"":** Typically involves attempts to connect to many different ports on the same host. Here, only **port 22** is targeted.
- **""pingScan"":** Involves ICMP packets (not TCP), used to discover hosts, not relevant here.
- **""---"" (Normal):** The attributes (especially short, repeated SSH connections) are suspicious, not normal.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attack Type    | Why/Why Not?                                                                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Normal         | Short, repeated SSH attempts are not typical of normal user behavior.                             |
| DoS            | Not enough packets/bytes and duration is too short for a DoS.                                     |
| PortScan       | Only one port (22) targeted, not multiple ports.                                                  |
| PingScan       | Not ICMP, but TCP traffic.                                                                        |
| **BruteForce** | **Multiple short SSH connections: matches the pattern of brute force attempts targeting SSH.**    |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It targets port 22 (SSH), a common brute-force target.
- It involves several packets and bytes in a very short time, consistent with automated login attempts.
- The TCP flags indicate quick connection, data transfer, and closure typical of login attempts.

**In summary:**  
> The combination of short duration, multiple SSH packets, and the flow's characteristics match the typical pattern of a brute force attack against SSH. That’s why it was classified as ""bruteForce.""


Explanation: 26

Let's break down the network flow and its attributes:

### Flow Details
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:35:07.638  
- **Duration:** 0.0 (very short, likely a single packet)
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 34697  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.8  
- **Dest port:** 22.0  (**SSH**)  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 74  
- **Flags:** ....S. (**SYN flag set**)

### What does this flow represent?
- **A single TCP packet with SYN flag set**: This is the first step in establishing a TCP connection (the SYN part of the three-way handshake).
- **Destination port 22**: This is the default port for SSH (Secure Shell), a protocol commonly targeted by attackers attempting to brute force login credentials.

### Why ""bruteForce""?  
**Brute force attacks** on SSH typically involve an attacker sending many connection attempts (SYN packets) to port 22, trying to guess login credentials. In an actual brute force attack, you would see many such flows from the same source IP to the destination IP/port (or from many different sources).

#### However, this specific flow:
- Is a **single SYN packet** to SSH (port 22).
- No evidence in this single flow alone of repeated attempts.

### So why was it labeled ""bruteForce""?

#### Possible explanations:
1. **Wider Context**: This flow may be one of many similar flows, collectively forming a brute force pattern (many SYNs to SSH port from same/different IPs).
2. **Labeling Rule**: The labeling process may have a rule that **any connection attempt to port 22 from outside the expected network, especially with no prior session, is suspicious** and flagged as brute-force-related, especially in the context of intrusion detection datasets.
3. **Dataset Bias**: Training datasets for cyber attack detection sometimes label all SSH connection attempts as ""bruteForce"" due to the high prevalence of such attacks in real-world data.

### Why **not** other classes?
- **""dos""**: Usually involves many packets, often to overwhelm resources. This is only a single packet.
- **""portScan""**: Usually scanning many ports on one or more hosts. Here, only port 22 is targeted.
- **""pingScan""**: Involves ICMP echo requests, not TCP SYN packets.
- **""---"" (Normal)**: Because port 22 is a common attack target, many IDS systems treat unsolicited SYN packets to port 22 as suspicious unless part of normal operational flows.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | Value             | Relevance to BruteForce            |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
| Protocol          | TCP              | SSH runs over TCP                  |
| Dest Port         | 22 (SSH)         | Target of brute-force attacks      |
| Flags             | SYN              | Start of connection (login attempt)|
| Packets/Bytes     | 1/74             | One login attempt (could be part of a series) |
| Duration          | 0.0              | No established connection          |

---

## **Conclusion**
**This flow was labeled ""bruteForce"" because it is a TCP SYN packet to port 22 (SSH), which is a common target for brute force login attempts. Even though it's a single packet, in the context of cybersecurity datasets and detection systems, such flows are often labeled as brute force since they may form part of a larger attack pattern.** 

If this flow is one of many similar SYN packets to port 22 from the same source, it would fit the brute force attack profile even more strongly.

---

**If you want to challenge this label, more context (multiple flows, timing, etc.) would be needed, but based on the common practices in attack labeling, this is the explanation.**


Explanation: 27

Let's analyze the given network flow and its attributes:

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:29:54.975  
- **Duration:** 0.997 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 34373  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.8  
- **Dest port:** 22.0 (SSH)  
- **Packets:** 2  
- **Bytes:** 148  
- **Flags:** ....S. (Only SYN flag set, no ACK, no FIN, etc.)

### Why was this classified as ""bruteForce""?

#### 1. **Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
- **SSH** is a common target for brute-force attacks, where an attacker tries many passwords or authentication attempts to gain access.

#### 2. **SYN Flag Only**
- The TCP flags indicate only the **SYN** flag is set (`....S.`), which means this flow is an attempt to initiate a new TCP connection (the very first step in a connection).  
- There are no subsequent flags (like ACK or FIN) in this flow, suggesting that either the connection was not completed (no handshake), or this is just one of many SYN packets.

#### 3. **Low Packet and Byte Count**
- Only **2 packets** and **148 bytes** transmitted. This is typical of a connection attempt that doesn't proceed to data exchange—often seen in scans or repeated failed login attempts.

#### 4. **Brute-force Attack Pattern**
- **Brute-force attacks** on SSH often involve many repeated connection attempts, each trying a new password. Each attempt starts with a SYN packet.
- On its own, a single SYN packet to port 22 could be normal, but in the context of a dataset, if there are many such flows from the same source IP to port 22, this is a strong indicator of brute-forcing.

#### 5. **Why not portScan or dos?**
- **PortScan** would typically involve SYN packets to a wide range of ports (not just 22).
- **DoS** would involve a high volume of traffic, often to overwhelm the service.
- **PingScan** would use ICMP, not TCP.

#### 6. **Labeling Context**
- In labeled datasets for attack detection, **single or many repeated SYN packets to SSH** from the same source are often labeled as brute-force, especially if they are not spread across different ports (which would be a port scan).

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute              | Value                    | BruteForce Indicator?         |
|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Destination port       | 22 (SSH)                 | **Yes** (common target)       |
| TCP Flags              | SYN only                 | **Yes** (connection attempt)  |
| Packets/Bytes          | Low                      | **Yes** (failed attempts)     |
| Protocol               | TCP                      | Yes                           |
| Behavior               | Repeated attempts (implied)| **Yes**                      |

---

### **Conclusion**
This flow was classified as **""bruteForce""** because it is an attempt to establish a TCP connection to an SSH server (port 22) with only the SYN flag set, which is indicative of a login attempt. In the context of many such flows, this pattern matches brute-force attack behavior, which involves repeated connection attempts to SSH in hopes of guessing a valid password.

**Note:** The actual classification relies on the context—if there are many such flows from the same source IP to port 22, it is a brute-force attack. If it's just a single SYN, it could be benign, but in labeled datasets, such flows are often marked as brute-force for training purposes.


Explanation: 28

Let's carefully analyze the provided network flow attributes and the reasoning behind the classification as **""bruteForce""**.

### Flow Attributes

- **Start time**: 2017-03-20 10:27:52.841
- **Duration**: 0.0 seconds
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Source IP**: 192.168.220.16
- **Source port**: 34360
- **Destination IP**: 192.168.200.8
- **Destination port**: 22 (SSH)
- **Packets**: 1
- **Bytes**: 74
- **Flags**: ....S. (only SYN flag is set)

### Analysis

#### 1. **What does this flow represent?**
- This is a single TCP SYN packet from 192.168.220.16:34360 to 192.168.200.8:22.
- Destination port 22 is the default port for SSH (Secure Shell).
- Only the SYN flag is set, which means this packet is attempting to **initiate a new TCP connection** (the very first step of a TCP handshake).

#### 2. **Why is it not ""normal"" or ""---""?**
- A single SYN packet by itself is not enough to say definitively whether the flow is malicious or not. In real traffic, legitimate users also initiate TCP connections in this way. However, context is important.

#### 3. **Why not ""dos""?**
- A DoS (Denial of Service) attack usually involves a high volume of packets, often with the intention of overwhelming the target. Here, only one packet is sent, which doesn't fit the DoS pattern.

#### 4. **Why not ""portScan"" or ""pingScan""?**
- PortScan: Usually involves sending SYN packets to **many different ports** on the same host, to find out which ports are open.
- PingScan: Typically uses ICMP (not TCP) to ""ping"" multiple hosts to see who is alive.
- Here, only one SYN is sent to a **single port (22)** on a **single host**.

#### 5. **Why ""bruteForce""?**
- BruteForce attacks, especially on SSH, are characterized by many **connection attempts** (often with different usernames or passwords) to the SSH port (22). **Each attempt starts with a SYN packet** to port 22.
- In flow-level datasets, especially if flows are cut short (e.g., due to timeouts or sampling), **each connection attempt may be logged as a single SYN packet**.
- The classifier (likely trained on previous data) may have learned that **even a single SYN to port 22 from a remote IP** is a strong signal for brute-force behavior, especially if many such flows are present in a short time frame (even if you only see one flow here).

#### 6. **Heuristic in automated detection:**
- **SSH brute-force attacks** often show up as many short-lived flows (one or a few packets) from the same source IP to port 22, sometimes with no completion of the handshake (just SYN).
- Even if you only see one such flow here, if this is part of a larger pattern, it would be consistent with brute-force activity.

## **Summary Table**

| Label        | Why Not This?                                                  |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ---          | Could be, but context and labeling suggest otherwise          |
| dos          | Only one packet, no high volume or attempt to overwhelm       |
| portScan     | Only one port targeted                                        |
| pingScan     | Not ICMP, not scanning hosts                                  |
| bruteForce   | SYN to port 22 (SSH), pattern matches brute-force activity    |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It is a TCP SYN packet aimed at port 22 (SSH), which is a common target for brute-force attacks.
- In flow-based intrusion detection, many flows consisting of SYN packets to SSH are a strong indicator of brute-force attempts.
- Even though this example only shows one flow, the labeling is likely based on a pattern seen in the dataset where multiple such flows indicate brute-force behavior.

**If you have only this flow, it's not enough to be sure, but in the context of network monitoring and automatic classification, this SYN to port 22 is considered suspicious and often associated with brute-force SSH attacks.**

---

**If you need to explain this to someone:**
> ""The flow was classified as 'bruteForce' because it represents an attempt to initiate a connection to SSH (port 22). Automated brute-force attacks typically involve many such connection attempts from a source IP, each starting with a SYN packet to port 22. The classifier, recognizing this pattern, labeled the flow as brute-force even though this example shows only a single attempt.""


Explanation: 29

Let's break down the flow attributes and the possible attack types:

#### **Flow Attributes**
- **Start Time:** 2017-03-21 13:20:11.748  
- **Duration:** 1.611 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 44721  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.4  
- **Dest port:** 22 (SSH)  
- **Packets:** 18  
- **Bytes:** 3791  
- **Flags:** .AP.SF  

#### **Possible Labels**
- ""---"" : Normal flow  
- ""dos"" : Denial of service  
- ""portScan"": Port Scan  
- ""bruteForce"": Bruteforce attack  
- ""pingScan"": Ping scan  

---

### **Explanation for ""bruteForce"" Classification**

#### **1. Destination Port is 22 (SSH)**
- **Port 22** is the default port for SSH, a common target for brute-force login attempts since attackers often try to guess usernames/passwords to gain unauthorized access.

#### **2. Number of Packets and Bytes**
- **18 packets and 3791 bytes** in a short duration (1.6 sec) indicate an established and active session, not just a simple connection check or scan.  
- In brute-force attacks, the attacker often sends multiple authentication attempts in quick succession, leading to more packets and data than a simple scan.

#### **3. TCP Flags: .AP.SF**
- **A (ACK):** Acknowledgment of received data.
- **P (PSH):** Push function, indicates data transfer.
- **S (SYN):** Initiate connection.
- **F (FIN):** Finish (close) connection.
- The sequence of flags shows a normal connection establishment (SYN), data exchange (ACK, PSH), and proper connection termination (FIN).
- **.AP.SF** suggests there was a full TCP conversation: handshake, data transfer, and clean close.

#### **4. Why Not Other Labels?**
- **""dos"":** DOS attacks usually involve a high number of packets or connections in a very short time, often to overwhelm a service. 18 packets is not enough for a DOS.
- **""portScan"":** Port scans typically involve SYN packets to many different ports (or at least to many destinations). This flow is to a single port (22).
- **""pingScan"":** Ping scans use ICMP, not TCP.
- **""---"":** The flow appears abnormal due to the number of packets in a short time to SSH.

#### **5. Why ""bruteForce""?**
- The attributes match behavior typical of brute-force attacks:
    - **Multiple packets** in a short duration to SSH.
    - **Full connection** established (not just SYNs as in a scan).
    - **Data transferred** (possibly failed authentication attempts).

**In summary:**  
> This flow was likely classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a TCP connection to the SSH port (22), with multiple packets and a non-trivial amount of data exchanged in a short period. The connection was fully established and terminated, indicating repeated interaction (such as multiple login attempts) rather than just scanning or flooding. These are characteristic signs of a brute-force attack on SSH.

---

**If you want a one-sentence summary:**  
> The flow was labeled ""bruteForce"" because it shows signs of repeated login attempts to SSH (port 22) from a single source, with multiple packets and data exchange in a short time, which matches brute-force attack patterns.


Explanation: 30

Let's analyze the provided network flow and **why it might have been classified as ""bruteForce""**:

---

### **Flow Attributes:**

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-20 10:03:27.794
- **Duration:** 0.009 seconds (9 milliseconds)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.200.4
- **Source Port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Destination Port:** 37211
- **Packets:** 5
- **Bytes:** 462
- **Flags:** .AP..F (ACK, PSH, FIN)

---

### **Interpretation:**

#### **1. Port and Protocol**
- **Source Port 22 (SSH):** This is significant. SSH is a common target for brute-force attacks, where attackers try many username/password combinations to gain access.
- **TCP Protocol:** SSH operates over TCP.

#### **2. Flow Direction**
- The flow is **from port 22 (SSH) to a high-numbered port** (37211) on the destination. Normally, a client connects *to* port 22 on a server, but here, the flow is *from* port 22, suggesting it might be a server-initiated response.

#### **3. Flags (.AP..F)**
- **A:** ACK (Acknowledgement)
- **P:** PSH (Push)
- **F:** FIN (Finish)
- This combination suggests this is an application data packet with the connection being closed at the end (FIN).
- No SYN flag, so this is not the start of a new connection, but a data transfer and closure.

#### **4. Packets and Duration**
- **5 packets, 462 bytes, 9 ms:** Indicates a short-lived connection with a small amount of data transferred.

---

### **Why ""bruteForce""?**

- **Brute-force attacks** are characterized by **many short-lived connections** to the authentication service (like SSH) in rapid succession, each trying different credentials.
- **This flow is consistent with one attempt:** Short duration, small data transfer, and immediate closure.
- **If the dataset or classifier sees many such flows in a short time from the same source or to the same destination port (SSH), it is likely to label them as brute-force attempts.**
- The classifier may have been trained on patterns where flows emanating from or to port 22, with rapid, repetitive, short-lived connections, are labeled as brute-force attacks.

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It is a TCP flow involving SSH (port 22).
- The connection is very short-lived and small, consistent with an unsuccessful login attempt.
- The pattern matches what is expected in brute-force attacks: many such flows in a short time, each representing a login attempt.

**Note:** While a *single* flow may not always be enough to conclusively declare brute-force, automated classifiers often use these signatures as part of their labeling, especially if seen in the context of other similar flows. If this is one of many similar flows, the classification makes even more sense.

---

**If you have more examples or context (e.g., a time window with many such flows), this would strengthen the brute-force classification further.**


Explanation: 31

Certainly! Let’s analyze the flow and why it was classified as **""bruteForce""**:

---
### **Flow Details**

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 12:15:54.065  
- **Duration:** 1.771 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.100.6  
- **Src port:** 22 *(SSH)*  
- **Dst IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Dst port:** 60997  
- **Packets:** 16  
- **Bytes:** 2547  
- **Flags:** .AP.SF

---

### **Step-by-step Reasoning**

#### **1. Source and Destination Ports**
- **Source port 22**: This is the default port for **SSH**.
- **Destination port 60997**: This is a high, ephemeral port, likely the client’s source port (but labeled as destination here).
- The connection is from a server (port 22) to a client (high port), which is typical for SSH responses.

#### **2. Protocol: TCP & Flags**
- **TCP Session**: SSH operates over TCP.
- **Flags: .AP.SF**
  - **A** (ACK), **P** (PSH), **S** (SYN), **F** (FIN)
  - The sequence suggests a full connection: SYN, data transfer (PSH/ACK), and session termination (FIN).

#### **3. Duration, Packets, and Bytes**
- **Duration: 1.771 seconds**  
- **Packets: 16**  
- **Bytes: 2547**

  For an SSH session, this is a short-lived connection with a modest amount of data.

#### **4. Attack Label Analysis**
Let’s match this flow to possible attack types:

- **Normal (""---"")**: Would be a regular SSH session, likely lasting longer or with more data.
- **DoS (denial of service)**: Usually involves a large number of packets/data/frequent connections to overwhelm a service. Here, only 16 packets.
- **PortScan**: Characterized by the source probing many different ports. Here, only one port is involved (22, SSH).
- **PingScan**: Involves ICMP (not TCP).
- **BruteForce**: Involves repeated attempts to authenticate to a service like SSH, often with short connections as each login attempt is made, possibly disconnected quickly after failure.

#### **5. Why BruteForce?**
- The flow is on **SSH (port 22)**, which is a very common target for brute-force attacks.
- The **short duration and small number of packets/bytes** suggest this is not an interactive session, but possibly a failed login attempt.
- Brute-force attacks often involve many short connections to SSH, each trying a different password.
- The **flags** indicate a full session setup and teardown, but the small data volume fits a failed authentication attempt (not a successful, interactive session).

---

### **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**

- It is a short-lived SSH (port 22/TCP) connection.
- The data size and duration are consistent with a failed login/connection attempt.
- Brute-force attacks often manifest as multiple, short SSH sessions as attackers try different credentials in rapid succession.

**No evidence of scanning (single port), DoS (low volume), or ping (not ICMP).**

### **Summary Table**

| Feature          | Value         | Reason for BruteForce Label                   |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Proto            | TCP          | SSH uses TCP                                  |
| Src port         | 22 (SSH)     | Common target for brute-force                 |
| Duration         | 1.771 s      | Short, typical of failed login attempts       |
| Packets/Bytes    | 16/2547      | Low, not a full SSH session                   |
| Flags            | .AP.SF       | Indicates full connection with data and close |
| Attack label     | bruteForce   | Matches SSH login brute-forcing behavior      |

---

**In summary:**  
*This is an SSH connection that is short, with little data exchanged, and fits the pattern of a brute-force attack attempt rather than normal usage or other types of attacks.*


Explanation: 32

Let's break down the flow attributes and the classification:

**Flow Attributes:**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-21 13:19:55.560
- **Duration:** 0.124 seconds (very short)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP / Port:** 192.168.220.16 : 44712
- **Destination IP / Port:** 192.168.200.4 : 22.0 (SSH service)
- **Packets:** 12
- **Bytes:** 3115
- **TCP Flags:** .AP.S.

**Classified as:** `""bruteForce""`

---

### Explanation

#### 1. **Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
- Port 22 is the default for SSH, a common target for brute-force login attempts, where an attacker tries many different username/password combinations in rapid succession.

#### 2. **Short Duration with Multiple Packets**
- The flow lasted **0.124 seconds** but exchanged **12 packets** and over **3000 bytes**. For a single legitimate SSH connection, this could be normal, but in the context of attack detection, the combination of short duration and multiple packets can indicate automated activity.

#### 3. **TCP Flags: .AP.S.**
- The flag sequence `.AP.S.` indicates:
  - **A**: ACK (Acknowledgment)
  - **P**: PSH (Push, asking to process data immediately)
  - **S**: SYN (Synchronize, used to initiate a connection)
- The presence of both SYN and ACK/PSH flags in a short window suggests multiple connection/setup attempts or rapid data exchanges—typical of scripts trying to brute-force logins.

#### 4. **Not a Port Scan or DoS**
- **PortScan** would typically show connections to **many different ports**, not just port 22.
- **DoS** would involve a much higher packet and byte rate, often with very high counts in a short time and often against a variety of resources, not just SSH.
- **PingScan** would use ICMP, not TCP.

#### 5. **Why Not Normal?**
- The activity is too rapid and ""bursty"" for a manual or normal SSH login, especially if similar flows are repeated.
- Automated brute-force tools often generate such flows: quick, repeated attempts to authenticate, each one perhaps failing, and then retrying.

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute           | Typical for BruteForce? | Why?                                              |
|---------------------|:----------------------:|---------------------------------------------------|
| Dest Port 22        | Yes                    | SSH brute-force is common                         |
| Short Duration      | Yes                    | Automated tools act rapidly                       |
| Multiple Packets    | Yes                    | Multiple login attempts in short time              |
| TCP Flags .AP.S.    | Yes                    | Repeated connection/data attempts                  |

---

### **Conclusion / Main Reason for Classification**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it represents a rapid, high-frequency interaction with the SSH service (port 22) in a short time, with TCP flags and packet counts typical of automated brute-force login attempts, rather than normal user activity or other attack types.**

Let me know if you need more technical details!


Explanation: 33

Let's break down the network flow attributes and why it was classified as **""bruteForce""**:

---

### Flow Attributes

- **Start time:** 2017-03-21 13:23:58.584  
- **Duration:** 1.44 seconds
- **Proto:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 45047  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.4  
- **Dest port:** 22 (commonly used for SSH)
- **Packets:** 16  
- **Bytes:** 3659  
- **Flags:** .AP.SF

---

### Reasoning for ""bruteForce"" Classification

#### 1. **Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
- Port 22 is used for SSH (Secure Shell), which is a common target for brute-force attacks.
- Brute-force attacks on SSH involve repeatedly trying different username/password combinations to gain unauthorized access.

#### 2. **Number of Packets and Bytes in Short Duration**
- **16 packets** and **3659 bytes** transmitted in **1.44 seconds**.  
- This is consistent with multiple rapid connection attempts or login attempts in a short time, as happens in brute-force attacks.

#### 3. **TCP Flags: .AP.SF**
- **A** (ACK), **P** (PSH), **S** (SYN), **F** (FIN)
- This sequence suggests the following:
  - **SYN** and **FIN** indicate session initiation and termination, possibly several quick connections.
  - **ACK** and **PSH** indicate data transfer (e.g., login attempts).
- The combination suggests active connections with payloads being sent, not just scanning.

#### 4. **Not Typical of DoS or Scans**
- **DoS** would show a much higher number of packets/bytes, often to overwhelm the service, not necessarily to port 22.
- **PortScan** would involve connecting to many different ports, not just port 22.
- **PingScan** would use ICMP, not TCP.

#### 5. **Source Port is High (Ephemeral)**
- Source port 45047 is a high-numbered port, typical for client-side in a connection, matching user-initiated SSH attempts.

### **Summary Table**

| Attack Type   | Typical Indicators | Why Not This?                |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| ---           | Normal flow       | Attacking activity detected  |
| dos           | High volume, single port | Lower volume, not overwhelming |
| portScan      | Many ports        | Only port 22 targeted        |
| bruteForce    | Many attempts on login port in short time | **MATCH** |
| pingScan      | ICMP protocol     | This is TCP                  |

---

### **Conclusion**

This flow is classified as **""bruteForce""** because it targets the SSH port (22), involves multiple packets and bytes in a short period (suggesting repeated login attempts), uses TCP with flags indicating active data exchange and session closure, and does not match the patterns of DoS, port scan, or ping scan.

---

**In short:**  
*The flow exhibits the typical characteristics of an SSH brute-force attack: rapid, repeated login attempts to port 22 in a short period.*


Explanation: 34

Let's analyze the flow and the available data:

**Flow attributes:**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 11:11:38.168  
- **Duration:** 0.996 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source port:** 59334  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8  
- **Destination port:** 22.0 (SSH)  
- **Packets:** 2  
- **Bytes:** 148  
- **TCP Flags:** ....S. (SYN flag set)  

**Classification:** ""bruteForce""

---

### Step-by-step Explanation

1. **Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
   - Port 22 is **commonly used for SSH**. SSH services are frequent targets for brute force attacks, where attackers repeatedly try username/password combinations.

2. **TCP SYN Flag (....S.)**
   - The only TCP flag observed is the SYN flag.
   - This means this flow represents a **connection attempt** (the initial handshake packet).
   - There are **two packets**, possibly a SYN from source and a SYN-ACK/RST in response, or a SYN retransmission if no response.

3. **Short Duration, Few Packets**
   - The connection did not progress far; only 2 packets and less than 1 second duration.
   - This is **typical for failed or repeated connection attempts**.

4. **Brute Force Attack Behavior**
   - **Brute force attacks on SSH** typically involve **many rapid connection attempts** with various credentials.
   - Each attempt starts with a SYN packet to port 22.
   - If you see **many flows like this** from the same source to port 22, it's a strong indicator of brute force.

5. **Why not a Port Scan or DoS?**
   - **Port Scan:** Would involve attempts to multiple ports, not just port 22.
   - **DoS:** Would involve a high number of packets/bytes, or repeated attempts to overwhelm the service—not just a couple of SYNs.
   - **Ping Scan:** Would use ICMP, not TCP.

6. **Why not normal (""---"")?**
   - A normal SSH connection would involve a SYN, then a handshake, then an exchange of many packets (authentication, session data).
   - A single SYN or very few packets, especially if repeated, is suspicious for brute force.

---

## **Summary**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It is a TCP SYN connection attempt to port 22 (SSH).
- The flow is very short and has only 2 packets, consistent with repeated login attempts.
- Such patterns are typical in SSH brute force attacks, where the attacker tries many connections in quick succession, each starting with a SYN to port 22.
- The lack of progression beyond the SYN suggests the connection was not established—again, typical of brute force scanning for valid credentials.

**If you have a dataset with many similar flows from the same source to port 22, this pattern strongly suggests a brute force attack, hence the classification.**


Explanation: 35

Let's analyze your network flow and see why it might be classified as **""bruteForce""**.

### Flow Attributes:
- **Start Time:** 2017-03-20 10:01:55.289  
- **Duration:** 0.007 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source Port:** 35825  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.4  
- **Destination Port:** 22.0 (**SSH**)  
- **Packets:** 5  
- **Bytes:** 610  
- **Flags:** `.AP..F` (ACK, PSH, FIN)

---

## Step-by-step Reasoning

### 1. **Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
- Port **22** is the default port for the **SSH (Secure Shell)** protocol, commonly targeted for **brute force attacks** because attackers try to guess usernames and passwords.

### 2. **Short Duration, Multiple Packets**
- The flow is **very short** (0.007 seconds) but contains **5 packets**, suggesting rapid communication, consistent with automation (such as brute force scripts) rather than normal interactive SSH sessions.

### 3. **TCP Flags: `.AP..F`**
- **A**CK: Acknowledgement  
- **P**SH: Push (data being sent)  
- **F**IN: Finish (connection termination)
- This flag sequence suggests a short data exchange followed by an immediate connection close, which is typical of **failed login attempts** (send data, receive response, close connection).

### 4. **Brute Force Attack Pattern**
- In brute force attacks, there are usually:
  - **Repeated, rapid SSH connections**
  - Each connection is short, with a small number of packets/bytes (just enough to send a login attempt and get a response)
  - The attacker tries many combinations of passwords in quick succession

### 5. **Why Not Other Labels?**
- **dos:** Not enough packets/bytes for a denial of service, and no evidence of overwhelming traffic.
- **portScan:** Would typically involve many destination ports, not just port 22.
- **pingScan:** Would use ICMP, not TCP/22.
- **--- (normal):** Normal SSH sessions last longer, involve more packets, and are less repetitive.

---

## **Conclusion**
**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It targets SSH (**port 22**), a common brute force target.
- It is short-lived, with just enough packets and data for a login attempt.
- The TCP flags indicate a quick attempt and disconnect, typical of brute force tools.
- The behavior matches the pattern of automated password-guessing attacks, rather than normal SSH usage.

---

**In summary:**  
*A short, repetitive TCP flow to port 22 with minimal packets and quick termination is a hallmark of brute force SSH attacks, which is why this flow was classified as ""bruteForce"".*


Explanation: 36

Certainly! Let’s break down why this network flow might have been classified as **""bruteForce""** based on its attributes:

---

### 1. **Destination Port: 22 (SSH)**
- **Port 22** is the default port for **SSH** (Secure Shell), which is often targeted for brute force attacks as attackers attempt to guess login credentials.

### 2. **Source/Destination IPs**
- The flow is from `192.168.220.16` (source) to `192.168.100.4` (destination), both in private address space, suggesting internal traffic or a test environment. This doesn’t affect attack type, but contextually, brute force attacks often come from one host to another.

### 3. **Protocol: TCP**
- SSH runs over TCP, which is correct for brute force SSH attacks.

### 4. **Number of Packets/Bytes and Duration**
- **11 packets**, **3049 bytes**, over **0.143 seconds**. 
- Brute force attacks involve a burst of packets, as the attacker tries multiple login attempts in quick succession. While this count/duration is small (*possibly a single attempt or initial stage*), IDS/flow classifiers can flag even short bursts if they match brute force patterns.

### 5. **TCP Flags: `.AP.S.`**
- The flag string shows presence of:
  - **A** (ACK)
  - **P** (PSH)
  - **S** (SYN)
- The combination of **SYN** and **ACK/PSH** suggests an active session is being established and data (possibly login attempts) is being pushed immediately after connection setup.
- Brute force attacks often show repeated SYN and rapid data transfer (login attempts).

### 6. **Why not the other categories?**
- **DoS**: Usually involves a very high number of packets/bytes or repeated SYNs, often across many ports or repeated connections, aiming to overwhelm the service. This is a single flow with moderate traffic.
- **PortScan**/**PingScan**: Would involve connections to many ports or ICMP packets to many hosts, not just a single port 22.
- **Normal (""---"")**: While legitimate SSH connections exist, a classifier may see the rapid burst (11 packets in 0.14s) with the SYN/PSH/ACK flags as suspicious, especially if this pattern is repeated in other flows.

## **Summary Table**

| Feature              | Value                                 | Brute Force Reasoning                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Destination Port     | 22 (SSH)                              | Common brute force target              |
| Protocol             | TCP                                   | SSH uses TCP                           |
| Packets/Bytes        | 11 packets, 3049 bytes, 0.143 seconds | Burst of data in short time            |
| TCP Flags            | .AP.S.                                | Session setup + immediate data push    |
| Pattern              | Single host to SSH, rapid activity    | Matches brute force login attempt      |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It is a TCP flow to the SSH port (22), a common brute force target.
- The combination of SYN, ACK, and PSH flags suggests a connection was made and data (likely login attempts) was sent immediately.
- The flow is short but contains multiple packets, resembling the pattern of automated brute force scripts rather than interactive human SSH use.
- The classifier likely uses these features (port, flags, duration, packet count) to identify brute force attempts.

---

If you have more flows or context, the classifier may also be looking for repeated such flows from the same source, but **even a single such burst to SSH can be a brute force indicator depending on the detection threshold**.

**Let me know if you want more technical details about the flag sequence or further breakdown!**


Explanation: 37

Certainly! Let me break down the reasoning for why this flow was classified as **""bruteForce""** based on the attributes you provided:

## 1. **Destination Port: 22**
- **Port 22** is the default port for **SSH (Secure Shell)**, a common target for brute force attacks, where attackers try many different username/password combinations to gain unauthorized access.

---

## 2. **TCP Protocol**
- **TCP** is used, which is expected for SSH connections.

---

## 3. **Flow Duration & Packet Count**
- **Duration:** 0.121 seconds (very short)
- **Packets:** 11
- **Bytes:** 3049

This indicates a relatively high number of packets and bytes for such a short period, which could suggest multiple rapid connection attempts or authentication tries, typical of brute forcing.

---

## 4. **TCP Flags: `.AP.S.`**
- **A** (ACK), **P** (PSH), **S** (SYN)
- **No FIN or RST** (no explicit termination or reset)
- The presence of **SYN** suggests a connection attempt. The **ACK** and **PSH** are consistent with data being sent (such as login attempts).

---

## 5. **Source/Destination**
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.4
- **Source Port:** High/ephemeral (37214)
- **Destination Port:** 22 (SSH)
- A **client** is initiating a connection to an SSH server.

---

## 6. **Why Not Other Labels?**
- **""dos""**: For Denial of Service, you would expect either a very high number of packets/bytes or repeated connections in a pattern to overwhelm the service, often with RST flags or no data payload.
- **""portScan"" / ""pingScan""**: Port scans usually involve connections to many different ports or IPs, often with a SYN flag and little or no follow-up data. Here, only port 22 is targeted.
- **""---"" (Normal flow):** Typical SSH connections may have fewer packets in a short duration unless they're legitimate logins, which usually take longer or have fewer data exchanges.

---

## 7. **Brute Force Attack Indicators**
- **SSH port targeted**
- **Short burst of packets/data** in a very short duration
- **Multiple packets**: Suggests rapid consecutive login attempts
- **No termination (FIN/RST)**: The session may be getting interrupted before the handshake completes, possibly due to failed login attempts.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Feature         | Value                             | Relevance to Brute Force   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Dest Port       | 22                                | SSH, common brute force target |
| Duration        | 0.121s                            | Many attempts in short time    |
| Packets         | 11                                | Multiple rapid attempts       |
| Flags           | .AP.S.                            | SYN and data sent, no close   |
| Data volume     | 3049 bytes                        | Consistent with repeated login attempts |
| Proto           | TCP                               | Used by SSH                   |

---

## **Conclusion**
**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce""** because it matches the typical pattern of a brute force attack on SSH:
- Rapid, repeated, or automated connection attempts to SSH port 22
- Multiple packets and significant data in a very short time
- TCP flags consistent with repeated login/data attempts
- No evidence of port/ping scanning behavior

**In essence, the combination of targeting port 22, the burst of packets/data in a short interval, and the TCP flag pattern are strong indicators of SSH brute force activity.**


Explanation: 38

Let's analyze the flow attributes and the possible reasoning behind its classification as **""bruteForce""**:

- **Duration**: 0.183 seconds (very short)
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Src IP / Port**: 192.168.220.16 : 44760
- **Dest IP / Port**: 192.168.200.4 : 22 (SSH)
- **Packets**: 11
- **Bytes**: 3049
- **Flags**: .AP.S. (**ACK, PSH, SYN**)

---

### **Explanation for ""bruteForce"" Classification**

#### **1. Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
- Port 22 is the default port for SSH. SSH is a common target for brute-force password attacks, where an attacker tries many username/password combinations to gain access.

#### **2. Short Duration with Multiple Packets**
- The flow lasted only **0.183 seconds** but included **11 packets** and **3049 bytes**. This suggests rapid communication, which can be typical of automated tools attempting multiple login attempts.

#### **3. TCP Flags: .AP.S.**
- The flag sequence includes **SYN** and **ACK/PSH**:
  - **SYN**: Indicates the start of a TCP connection (handshake).
  - **ACK/PSH**: Indicates data is being sent (likely login attempts) and acknowledged.
- Multiple packets with these flags in a short time frame is consistent with repeated connection and data attempts, such as those generated by brute-force attack tools.

#### **4. Number of Packets and Bytes**
- For an SSH login attempt, a small number of packets and bytes would be exchanged. However, **11 packets and 3049 bytes** in such a short time may indicate repeated login attempts or rapid failed login exchanges.

#### **5. Not Consistent with Other Attack Types**
- **DoS**: Usually much higher packet/byte counts, longer duration or many simultaneous flows.
- **Port Scan**: Would involve multiple destination ports, not just port 22.
- **Ping Scan**: Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **Normal**: Would typically not show such a burst of packets to SSH in a short window.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute      | Normal | DoS | PortScan | BruteForce | PingScan |
|----------------|--------|-----|----------|------------|----------|
| Dest Port 22   | ✔️     |     |          | ✔️         |          |
| Short Duration |        |     |          | ✔️         |          |

| High Bytes     |        |     |          | ✔️         |          |
| Single Dest Port | ✔️     |     |          | ✔️         |          |

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**

- **It is a short, high-activity TCP session targeting SSH (port 22), which is a classic target for brute-force attacks.**
- **The high number of packets and bytes in such a short duration suggests automated login attempts rather than normal user activity.**
- **The TCP flags indicate repeated session initiations and data transfer, likely corresponding to multiple login attempts in rapid succession.**
- **Other attack types (DoS, PortScan, PingScan) do not match the attributes of this flow.**

**In summary:**  
>This flow matches the typical signature of a brute-force SSH attack: rapid, repeated connection attempts with data sent to port 22 in a short period.


Explanation: 39

Let's analyze the flow and the possible reasoning behind its classification as **""bruteForce""**:

### Flow Breakdown

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:01:55.414  
- **Duration:** 0.122 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP/Port:** 192.168.220.16:35847  
- **Destination IP/Port:** 192.168.200.4:22  
- **Packets:** 12  
- **Bytes:** 3115  
- **Flags:** .AP.S.

### Destination Port: **22**
- **Port 22** is the default port for **SSH** (Secure Shell), a common target for brute-force attacks as attackers try many username/password combinations to gain access.

### Flow Characteristics:

- **Short Duration, Multiple Packets:**  
  - 12 packets in 0.122 seconds indicates a burst of traffic in a very short window, which is characteristic of automated tools used in brute-force attempts.
- **Relatively High Byte Count:**  
  - 3115 bytes in just 12 packets and 0.122 seconds suggests substantial data exchange, likely due to repeated login attempts.
- **TCP Flags:**  
  - **.AP.S.**  
    - **A:** ACK (Acknowledgement)
    - **P:** PSH (Push; data transfer)
    - **S:** SYN (Synchronization, start of a connection)
    - The presence of **SYN** and **ACK/PSH** flags in the same flow suggests connection establishment and data transfer—consistent with repeated login attempts.

### Why **not** other labels?

- **""dos"":**  
  - Denial-of-Service attacks usually flood the target with high volumes of packets, often to disrupt service, but here the packet count and byte count are moderate.
- **""portScan"":**  
  - Port scans typically target multiple ports, not just one (here, only port 22 is targeted).
- **""pingScan"":**  
  - Ping scans use ICMP, not TCP.
- **""---"" (Normal):**  
  - The flow characteristics (many packets in short time to SSH) are abnormal for legitimate human SSH access, which usually has fewer, more spaced-out connection attempts.

### Why **""bruteForce""?**

- **Targeting SSH (port 22):**  
  - SSH is a high-value target for brute-force login attempts.
- **Connection Pattern:**  
  - High number of packets and bytes in a very short span, with connection and data transfer (SYN, ACK, PSH flags) suggest an automated process, likely trying multiple login credentials quickly.
- **No evidence of scanning or overwhelming traffic:**  
  - The attack is focused on a single service/port (SSH), not scanning a range of ports or flooding the service.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute              | Value                    | BruteForce Clue?          |
|------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Dest Port              | 22 (SSH)                 | Yes                       |
| Packets                | 12 in 0.122s             | Yes (bursty/automated)    |
| Bytes                  | 3115                     | Yes (multiple attempts)   |
| TCP Flags              | .AP.S.                   | Yes (connection + data)   |
| Other ports involved?  | No (only port 22)        | Yes                       |

---

## **Conclusion**
This flow is classified as **""bruteForce""** because it displays the typical signs of a brute-force attack against an SSH service:

- Multiple rapid connection attempts to SSH (port 22).
- Significant packet and byte counts in a very short time.
- TCP flags indicating repeated connection establishment and data transfer.

These characteristics match known patterns of brute-force attacks, where an attacker tries many passwords in quick succession to gain unauthorized access.

Explanation: 40

Let's break down the flow attributes and analyze **why it could be classified as ""bruteForce"":**

---

### **Flow Attributes Recap**
- **Start Time:** 2017-03-20 12:15:50.916  
- **Duration:** 0.167 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.100.6  
- **Source Port:** 22  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Destination Port:** 60985  
- **Packets:** 11  
- **Bytes:** 2085  
- **Flags:** .AP.S.

---

### **Analysis**

#### **1. Source Port 22**
- **Port 22** is the default port for **SSH (Secure Shell)**.
- SSH is commonly targeted for **bruteforce attacks**, where an attacker tries many password combinations to gain access.

#### **2. Destination Port 60985**
- This is an **ephemeral (high) port** on the destination, typical for client-side connections.

#### **3. Flow Direction**
- Source: 192.168.100.6:22 (server) → Dest: 192.168.220.16:60985 (client)
- This suggests that the *server* is sending data to a *client* (possibly a response to a connection attempt).

#### **4. Number of Packets and Bytes**
- **11 packets and 2085 bytes** in **0.167 seconds** means a burst of activity in a short time, which is typical in automated attacks.

#### **5. TCP Flags: .AP.S.**
- **A**CK, **P**SH, and **S**YN flags are set.
- The combination of SYN and ACK/PSH flags may indicate session establishment and data transfer (possibly login attempts/responses).

---

### **Why ""bruteForce""?**

- **Typical brute force attack pattern:**  
  - Many SSH connections in a short time, or repeated login attempts.
  - Multiple packets exchanged rapidly.
  - Originates from or targets port 22.
- This flow matches:
  - *Source port 22* (SSH).
  - *Short duration, burst of packets* (indicative of rapid login attempts).
  - *TCP flags* show active session negotiation and data transfer, potentially multiple authentication attempts.

- **What is missing?**
  - Usually, we'd expect to see more connections from the attacking IP to port 22. However, sometimes flows are recorded from the server's perspective as it handles repeated failed logins (possibly as a server response to each attempt).

---

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute      | Value             | Relevance to BruteForce  |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Src Port       | 22                | SSH Target               |
| Duration       | 0.167s            | Rapid activity           |
| Packets        | 11                | Multiple attempts        |
| Bytes          | 2085              | Data exchanged           |
| TCP Flags      | .AP.S.            | Session/data exchange    |

---

## **Conclusion**
**This flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It involves SSH (port 22), a common target for bruteforce attacks.
- There is a rapid burst of connections/data in a short time.
- The pattern of activity (number of packets, flags, and protocol) matches known bruteforce behavior, where multiple authentication attempts are performed in quick succession.

**In short:**  
> **The flow shows a rapid sequence of SSH-related packets, typical of automated bruteforce login attempts.**

Explanation: 41

Let's analyze your network flow and the classification:

---

### **Flow Attributes Recap**

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 11:03:44.360  
- **Duration:** 0.004 seconds  
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.100.6  
- **Src port:** 80  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Dest port:** 55922  
- **Packets:** 2  
- **Bytes:** 132  
- **Flags:** .A...F (**ACK** and **FIN**)

---

## **Analysis**

### **1. Protocol:**
- **TCP** is used for reliable, connection-oriented sessions (such as login attempts).

### **2. Source/Destination Ports:**
- **Source port 80** (HTTP), which is a well-known web server port.
- **Destination port 55922** is a high-numbered (ephemeral) port, likely a client port.

### **3. Packet and Byte Count:**
- Only **2 packets** and **132 bytes** were exchanged. This suggests a very short interaction.

### **4. TCP Flags:**
- **.A...F** means **ACK** and **FIN** are set.
  - This is typical for a session teardown (ending a connection).

### **5. Duration:**
- The connection lasted **0.004 seconds**—extremely brief.

---

## **Brute Force Attack Characteristics** 

A **brute force attack** typically involves an attacker attempting to guess credentials (usernames/passwords) by trying many combinations in rapid succession. This results in:

- A large number of short-lived TCP connections.
- Many connections to the same server port (often to login services like HTTP, SSH, FTP, etc.).
- Most connections are terminated quickly after a failed login attempt.

---

## **Why Was This Flow Labeled ""bruteForce""?**

- **Source port 80** (HTTP) suggests the connection initiated from a web server (possibly a proxy or compromised server), or traffic is being replayed/faked.
- The **destination port 55922** indicates the connection is being made to a client or service running on a non-standard port, possibly a honeypot or a custom application.
- The **very short duration** and **minimal data exchanged** (2 packets, 132 bytes) are typical of failed login attempts or connection attempts that are quickly closed.
- The **ACK/FIN flags** show the connection was acknowledged and then immediately closed—again, typical of many brute force attempts.
- **No SYN flag** in the flow flags (not shown here, possibly because this record is aggregated or only covers the closing half of the connection).

**In real-world brute force scenarios**, you see many such flows in a short period from one source IP to a destination service. Even a single such flow, if fitting this pattern, might be labeled ""bruteForce"" by an automated system trained on similar data.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Feature        | Value                    | Brute Force Indicator? |
|----------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Packets        | 2                       | Yes (very short)       |
| Duration       | 0.004s                  | Yes (very short)       |
| Flags          | ACK, FIN                | Yes (aborted session)  |
| Bytes          | 132                     | Yes (minimal data)     |
| Src port       | 80                      | Possibly (web-based)   |
| Dest port      | 55922                   | Not typical, but could be login service on a non-standard port |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow is labeled ""bruteForce"" because it matches the pattern of a brute force attempt: a very short, minimal exchange over TCP, suggestive of an automated tool rapidly attempting and failing to authenticate.**  
If you see many such flows from the same source, it's even more strongly indicative of brute force activity.

**Note:**  
If this is an isolated flow, it may be a false positive, but if it's part of a pattern, the classification is justified.

### **If you have more flows or context, the classification might be more evident. Let me know if you want to see how to identify other attack types!**


Explanation: 42

Let's break down the network flow and your question:

### The Flow Details

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 12:37:03.192  
- **Duration:** 0.127 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source port:** 51255  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.100.4  
- **Destination port:** 22 (SSH)  
- **Packets:** 12  
- **Bytes:** 3115  
- **Flags:** .AP.S. (ACK, PSH, SYN)  

### Classified as: **""bruteForce""**

---

## Why is this a ""bruteForce"" attack?

### 1. **Destination Port is 22 (SSH)**
- Port 22 is the default for SSH, a common target for brute-force attacks where attackers try many username/password combinations to gain access.

### 2. **High Number of Packets in a Short Duration**
- **12 packets** and **3115 bytes** sent in only **0.127 seconds** is relatively high for a single SSH connection.  
- Brute-force attacks often involve rapid, repeated login attempts, resulting in bursts of packets in a short time.

### 3. **TCP Flags: .AP.S. (ACK, PSH, SYN)**
- **SYN**: Indicates the start of a TCP connection (connection attempt).
- **ACK**: Acknowledge receipt of data, expected in established connections.
- **PSH**: Indicates data should be pushed to the application immediately.
- The presence of **SYN** along with other flags suggests that the flow included at least one connection attempt (or possibly multiple overlapping connections, depending on how the flow is aggregated).  
- The combination of these flags could be consistent with repeated or rapid connection attempts, as seen in brute-force attacks.

### 4. **Source Port is High (Ephemeral)**
- Source port 51255 is a high, random port, typical for client connections.

### 5. **No Evidence of Port Scanning**
- Both IP and port are fixed (not varying), which is not characteristic of a port scan (where the destination port or IP would change).

### 6. **Not DoS or Ping Scan**
- The number of packets and bytes is not high enough for a DoS attack.
- ICMP (Ping) is not used, so it’s not a Ping Scan.

### 7. **Behavior Consistent with Brute-Force Attacks**
- Brute-force SSH attacks often involve a flood of connection attempts (or rapid data exchange) to a single IP and port (SSH), as attackers try to guess credentials.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute       | Observation                                  | Indicates BruteForce? |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|:--------------------:|
| Dest Port       | 22 (SSH)                                     | ✔️                   |
| Duration        | Short (0.127s)                               | ✔️                   |
| Packets/Bytes   | 12 packets, 3115 bytes in short time         | ✔️                   |
| TCP Flags       | SYN, ACK, PSH (connection, data exchange)    | ✔️                   |
| Fixed Dest IP   | Single target, not scanning                  | ✔️                   |
| Protocol        | TCP (used by SSH)                            | ✔️                   |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It involves a burst of packets to the SSH port (22) on a single host in a very short period, which is characteristic of automated password-guessing attempts typical in brute-force attacks. The packet count, data volume, and TCP flags suggest repeated or rapid login attempts, not normal SSH usage or scanning.**

Explanation: 43

Let's break down your flow attributes and analyze **why it was classified as ""bruteForce""**:

---

### **Flow Attributes Recap**

- **Start time:** 2017-03-21 13:23:23.611  
- **Duration:** 0.157 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.200.4  
- **Source Port:** 22  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Destination Port:** 45032  
- **Packets:** 12  
- **Bytes:** 2151  
- **Flags:** .AP.S.

---

## **Step-by-Step Analysis**

### **1. Source Port 22 (SSH)**
- **Port 22** is the default port for **SSH** (Secure Shell), a protocol commonly targeted for brute-force attacks by trying many username/password combinations.

### **2. Destination Port is High (> 1024)**
- The **destination port, 45032**, suggests the **connection is initiated from the server** (192.168.200.4) to a client, or this could be a reply from the server to an incoming SSH connection from the client at port 45032.

### **3. Flow Duration & Packet Count**
- **Very short duration (0.157 sec)** and **12 packets**. Brute-force attacks often involve a high number of short-lived connection attempts as the attacker tries many credential combinations rapidly.
- However, this could also be a normal connection, but the context of many such flows in a short period would be more indicative.

### **4. Flags: .AP.S.**
- These are TCP flags observed in the flow:
    - **A:** ACK (Acknowledgment)
    - **P:** PSH (Push)
    - **S:** SYN (Synchronize)
- The combination "".AP.S."" suggests multiple stages in the TCP handshake and data transfer occurred. This can indicate an attempt to establish a session and send data (such as login attempts).

### **5. Why Not Other Labels?**
- **""dos"":** Typically involves a very high number of packets or connections aiming to exhaust resources, often not involving port 22.
- **""portScan""/""pingScan"":** Would involve connections to *multiple ports* or ICMP echo requests, not repeated attempts to port 22.
- **""---"" (Normal):** Unlikely, because normal SSH usage typically involves longer sessions and fewer distinct, rapid flows to a high destination port.
- **""bruteForce"":** SSH brute-force attacks show up as *many short-lived flows* to port 22, often with failed login attempts.

---

### **Summary**

**This network flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**

- The source port is 22 (SSH), a common brute-force target.
- The flow is short-lived and consists of multiple packets, consistent with rapid login attempts.
- The TCP flags (.AP.S.) suggest repeated session initiations and data transfers, which align with repeated login attempts typical in brute-force attacks.
- The destination port is ephemeral (45032), likely representing a client-side port in an incoming connection attempt.

**In practice, brute-force detection algorithms look for patterns like:**
- Many short SSH flows from/to the same IP within a small time window.
- Repeated flows to port 22 from the same or different IPs.

**This flow fits the pattern of a brute-force SSH attack.**

---

**If you have a series of similar flows (many short SSH connections), that would reinforce the brute-force classification.**


Explanation: 44

Let's carefully analyze the provided flow and the likely reasoning behind its ""bruteForce"" classification.

### Flow Attributes Recap:

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:31:59.892
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source port:** 34384
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Destination port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 74
- **TCP Flags:** ....S. (This is a SYN packet)

---

## Step-by-step Reasoning

### 1. **Nature of the Packet**
- The flow consists of a single **TCP SYN** packet (indicated by the ""S"" in the Flags).
- The destination port is **22**, which is the default port for **SSH**.

### 2. **Zero Duration and Single Packet**
- The **duration is 0.0 seconds** and **only one packet** (a SYN) was sent. This suggests an **attempt to initiate a connection**, not a sustained communication.

### 3. **Why not other attack types?**
- **Normal flow:** Usually, this would require a successful connection or at least some data exchange, not just a single SYN.
- **DOS:** Denial of Service attacks typically involve many packets, high frequency, or resource exhaustion. This is just one SYN packet.
- **PortScan:** Port scans involve sending packets (often SYNs) to **multiple ports** on one or more hosts to see which are open. Here, only port 22 is targeted.
- **PingScan:** This is usually done with ICMP packets, not TCP SYNs.

### 4. **Why ""bruteForce""?**
- **Brute force attacks** on SSH involve many attempts to connect to port 22, often with different credentials, but they **start with a SYN** each time.
- If this flow is part of a **larger sequence** from the same source IP, repeatedly sending SYN packets to port 22 (possibly with rapid retries or to different usernames/passwords), it fits the brute-force attack pattern.
- **Key:** The classifier might be seeing this as a representative ""step"" in a brute-force attack, even if this individual flow is just the initial SYN for a connection attempt.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute          | Value           | Relevance to Brute Force         |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Protocol           | TCP            | SSH uses TCP                     |
| Destination Port   | 22 (SSH)       | Common brute-force target        |
| TCP Flags          | SYN            | Connection initiation            |
| Packets            | 1              | Start of connection attempt      |
| Duration           | 0.0            | Single attempt (may be repeated) |

---

## **Explanation**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it represents a TCP SYN packet attempting to connect to the SSH port (22), which is a common target for brute-force attacks. While a single SYN packet isn't enough to confirm a brute-force attack on its own, in context (such as part of a series of similar flows from the same source IP to port 22), this pattern is strongly indicative of brute-force attempts, where attackers try to repeatedly establish SSH connections in order to guess valid login credentials.**

**In summary:**  
> *A TCP SYN packet to port 22 is a typical first step in an SSH brute-force attack. Even a single flow like this may be labeled ""bruteForce"" as part of a broader detection strategy, especially if many such attempts are observed from the same source.*

### **Label Assigned:**  
**""bruteForce""**

---

## **Explanation:**

### **1. Analysis of the Flow**

- **Port 22 (SSH):**  
  The destination port is 22, which is used for SSH. SSH is a common target for brute force attacks, where attackers try many username/password combinations to gain access.

- **Single SYN Packet:**  
  The TCP Flags field is ""....S."" — only the SYN flag is set. This means this flow is only the initial connection attempt, with no response packet captured.  
  - **No ACK or other flags:** Indicates this is the very first packet in an attempt to establish a TCP connection.

- **One Packet, 74 Bytes:**  
  A single SYN packet is typical of the start of a TCP handshake.

### **2. Why Not Other Attack Types?**

- **Normal (""---""):**  
  There is nothing inherently malicious about a single SYN to SSH, but context matters.

- **DoS (""dos""):**  
  DoS typically involves many packets/bytes, or repetitive SYN packets to overwhelm the server. Here, it's only a single packet.

- **PortScan (""portScan""):**  
  A port scan typically sends SYN packets to *multiple* ports on the same host, or to the same port on many hosts, to discover open ports. Here, only port 22 is targeted.

- **PingScan (""pingScan""):**  
  This would involve ICMP packets, not TCP SYN to port 22.

### **3. Why ""bruteForce""?**

- **Brute Force Attacks on SSH:**  
  Brute force attacks on SSH start with repeated connection attempts to port 22, often with different credentials.  
  - Each attempt begins with a SYN packet.
  - If you see **many such flows** from the same source to port 22 in a short time, this *pattern* is typical of brute force attacks.
  - Even a **single SYN packet** to SSH may be flagged as brute force if it's part of a known attack pattern or in a dataset labeled this way.

- **Dataset and Labeling Context:**  
  In many intrusion detection datasets, flows are labeled based on ground truth about attack campaigns. If this SYN to port 22 comes from an IP known to be conducting brute force attempts, it may be labeled as such, even if this individual flow is just one SYN.

---

## **Summary**

**This flow is classified as ""bruteForce""** because:
- It is a TCP SYN packet to port 22 (SSH), which is a common target for brute force attacks.
- In the context of security datasets and intrusion detection, such flows are often labeled as brute force attempts if they are part of a sequence (even if this flow is just a single SYN).
- The labeling assumes that this kind of traffic is part of an automated brute force campaign, not legitimate use.

---

### **In Short**
> The flow is a TCP SYN to SSH (port 22), which is the typical beginning of an SSH brute force attempt. Even though it's just a single packet, in the context of attack detection and labeled datasets, such flows are marked as ""bruteForce"" because they match the pattern of how brute force attacks begin: repeated connection attempts to SSH.


Explanation: 46

Let's analyze your network flow and the provided classification:

---

### Flow Details

- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-20 11:05:06.444  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Transport Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source Port:** 57589  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8  
- **Destination Port:** 22 (SSH)  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 74  
- **TCP Flags:** ....S. (SYN only)

### Classification: **""bruteForce""**

---

## **Why was this flow classified as ""bruteForce""?**

### **1. Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
Port 22 is the default port for SSH, which is commonly targeted in brute force attacks because attackers often try to guess SSH credentials.

### **2. TCP SYN Packet**
The TCP flag is just SYN (`....S.`), which is the initial step in establishing a TCP connection. This is typically the first packet in a connection attempt.

### **3. Single Packet, No Data**
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 74  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
This suggests that this flow represents a *single connection attempt* (the SYN packet), without a completed handshake or data exchange.

### **4. Brute Force Attack Patterns**
In brute force attacks, especially on services like SSH, attackers send a high volume of connection attempts—often many SYN packets—to the SSH port, each attempt potentially trying a different username/password combination. Each attempt would look like a SYN packet to port 22.

### **5. Differentiation from Other Attack Types**
- **Port Scan:**  
  Would typically show SYN packets to a **range of ports**. Here, only port 22 is targeted.
- **Ping Scan:**  
  Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **DoS:**  
  Would usually involve **many packets** or a **flood** to overwhelm the service.
- **Normal flow:**  
  Would likely include a completed handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and some data exchange.

---

## **Putting it all together:**

This flow is a **single SYN packet** from a source to port 22 (SSH) on a destination. In the context of **network flow analysis** and typical intrusion detection labeling, **a high number of such flows from the same source to SSH** are characteristic of brute force attacks, where each connection attempt is a try at logging in.

**Even though this flow is just one SYN packet, if it is part of a pattern of many such attempts, it would be labeled as ""bruteForce"".** Given the data provided, the classifier may be using the knowledge that:
- **SYN to port 22** is a strong indicator of an SSH login attempt, and
- **Multiple such flows in the dataset** often imply brute force activity.

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute       | Value                | BruteForce Relevance                  |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Dest Port       | 22 (SSH)            | Common brute force target             |
| Flags           | SYN only            | Indicates connection attempt          |
| Packets         | 1                   | Typical for each brute force try      |
| Duration        | 0.0                 | No session established                |

---

### **Conclusion:**

**This flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a TCP SYN packet targeting SSH (port 22), which is typical of brute force attack patterns—especially if many similar flows are observed from the same source.** The classifier likely uses this simple signature (SYN to port 22) as an indicator of brute force login attempts.

---

**Note:**  
If this is an isolated flow, it could also be a normal connection attempt. However, intrusion detection systems often use context and patterns over time (not visible in a single flow) to make this determination.


Explanation: 47

Certainly! Let’s break down the flow attributes and explain why it was classified as **""bruteForce""**:

### 1. **Destination Port: 22**
- Port 22 is the default port for **SSH (Secure Shell)**.
- SSH is a common target for brute force attacks, where an attacker tries many different username/password combinations to gain access.

### 2. **Source and Destination IPs**
- The source and destination are both private IPs, indicating this is likely within a local network or lab environment.

### 3. **Flow Duration and Packets**
- **Duration:** 0.071 seconds (very short)
- **Packets:** 6
- **Bytes:** 676
  - This suggests a quick, small exchange—possibly an attempted login.

### 4. **TCP Flags: `.AP..F`**
- Decoded per packet, this means:
  - **A:** ACK (Acknowledgment)
  - **P:** PSH (Push)
  - **F:** FIN (Finish)
- The flag sequence suggests that the connection was made, some data was transmitted (perhaps a login attempt), and then the connection was closed.

### 5. **Why not other attack types?**
- **DOS:** A Denial of Service attack would have a much higher volume of packets and bytes, often with many repeated connections or floods.
- **PortScan:** Would show connections to multiple ports on the same or different hosts, not just one port (22).
- **PingScan:** Would use ICMP protocol, not TCP, and would target multiple hosts or addresses.
- **Normal (""---""):** While this could be a normal SSH login attempt, the context (especially if seen as part of repeated similar flows from the same source IP to the same destination port in a short time) suggests otherwise.

### 6. **Brute Force Attack Indicators**
- **SSH port (22) targeted**
- **Short, repeated connections:** Brute force attacks often involve many short-lived SSH connections, each attempting a different password.
- **Multiple small flows:** If this flow is one of many in a short time, all with similar characteristics, it fits the brute force pattern.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute       | Value                    | Why it's suspicious/brute force indicative |
|-----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Dest Port       | 22 (SSH)                | Common brute force target                  |
| Duration        | 0.071 sec (very short)  | Typical for failed login attempts          |
| Packets/Bytes   | 6 packets / 676 bytes   | Small connection, likely just an attempt   |
| Flags           | .AP..F                  | Data sent, then connection closed          |
| Context         | (If repeated)           | Pattern of brute force (many small tries)  |

---

### **Conclusion**
This flow is classified as **""bruteForce""** because it is a small, short-lived TCP connection to an SSH server (port 22), with a pattern typical of a login attempt—likely one of many similar attempts in a brute force attack. If your dataset shows many such flows from the same source, this is strong evidence of brute force activity.

If you have more context (for example, many such flows in sequence), the classification becomes even more certain. If this is a one-off, there is a chance it could be normal, but in cyber attack detection, such patterns to SSH are a common brute force indicator.


Explanation: 48

Let's break down the information you provided:

### Flow Attributes

- **Start time:** 2017-03-21 13:21:47.792  
- **Duration:** 0.164 seconds (very short)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.200.4
- **Src port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Dest port:** 44767
- **Packets:** 11
- **Bytes:** 2085
- **TCP Flags:** .AP.S.

### Classification: ""bruteForce""

**Brute force attacks** typically involve repeated attempts to authenticate (e.g., guessing passwords) to a particular service, most often SSH (port 22), within a short time span. Here's why this flow likely triggered the ""bruteForce"" label:

---

#### **Why this flow might be a brute-force attack:**

1. **Source Port 22 (SSH Service):**
   - The flow originates from port 22, which is almost always associated with SSH traffic. Brute force attacks are common on SSH as attackers try to guess credentials.

2. **Short Duration, High Packet Count:**
   - The session lasted only 0.164 seconds but involved **11 packets** and **2085 bytes**—a lot of data for such a short connection. This bursty, intense activity is typical of automated brute force tools, which try many logins rapidly.

3. **Unusual Destination Port:**
   - The destination port is **44767**, not the standard SSH port (22). This could indicate attempts to connect to SSH running on a non-standard port, a common brute-force tactic to evade basic detection.

4. **TCP Flags (.AP.S.):**
   - The flags show ACK (A), PSH (P), and SYN (S) set, with no FIN or RST, which suggests connection setup and data push. Brute force tools often quickly establish connections, send login attempts (data), and move on.

5. **Not a Normal Flow:**
   - This doesn't look like a typical, stable SSH session (which would have a longer duration, possibly more data, and more established connection flags). Instead, the pattern suggests rapid, repeated attempts.

---

### **Why not the other labels?**

- **""---"" (Normal Flow):**  
  Too many packets and bytes in too short a time—looks suspicious.

- **""dos"" (Denial of Service):**  
  DOS attacks usually involve a much higher volume of packets/data, often targeting service disruption, not login attempts.

- **""portScan"":**  
  A port scan would involve the source IP trying to connect to many different ports on the destination, not just one.

- **""pingScan"":**  
  Would use ICMP, not TCP on port 22.

---

## **Summary**

This flow was classified as **""bruteForce""** because:
- It is a short, intense SSH-related session,
- Involves more packets and data than a typical login attempt,
- Shows typical connection establishment and data transmission flags,
- And matches the behavior of automated brute force tools trying to guess SSH credentials, sometimes on non-standard ports.

**If you have more flows from this source IP to this or other destination ports, it would further strengthen the brute-force classification.**

**Let me know if you need more technical detail or have more flows to analyze!**


Explanation: 49

Let's analyze your network flow and why it may have been classified as **""bruteForce""**:

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-20 12:38:25.807
- **Duration:** 0.224 seconds
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source Port:** 51809
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.100.4
- **Destination Port:** 22.0 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 11
- **Bytes:** 3049
- **TCP Flags:** .AP.S. (ACK, PSH, SYN)

---

## Step-by-Step Reasoning

### 1. **Target is SSH (Port 22)**
- Port 22 is typically used for SSH connections.
- SSH is a common target for brute-force attacks, where an attacker tries many username/password combinations to gain access.

### 2. **Number of Packets and Bytes**
- **11 packets** and **3049 bytes** in just **0.224 seconds** indicate a rapid exchange.
- Such a short, intense burst of traffic, especially with small packets, is consistent with automated tools trying multiple login attempts quickly.

### 3. **TCP Flags: .AP.S.**
- The flags include **SYN** (S), which initiates connections, and **ACK/PSH** (AP), which are common in data transfer (e.g., sending credentials).
- The combination suggests multiple rapid connection attempts, possibly with immediate data transfer (which is what password-guessing tools do).

### 4. **Brute Force vs. Other Attack Types**
- **DoS**: Would typically involve many more packets/bytes and possibly target a service with the intent to overwhelm, not just SSH.
- **Port Scan/Ping Scan**: Would involve attempts to many different ports or IPs, not just a focused burst to SSH.
- **Normal Flow**: Would likely have longer duration, and the number of packets/bytes might be more consistent with an interactive SSH session.

### 5. **Why Not Normal?**
- A normal SSH connection usually has:
  - Fewer packets in the initial handshake.
  - More regular patterns (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, then session data).
  - Less bursty packet/byte counts for a first connection.
- This flow is **too short and too intense** for a legitimate login, suggesting automation.

---

## **Summary Explanation**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**

- It targets SSH (port 22), a common brute-force target.
- There is a rapid burst of packets and bytes in a very short time.
- The TCP flags indicate repeated connection attempts and data transfer.
- The pattern matches automated login attempts (brute-force), rather than manual or normal SSH usage.
- No evidence suggests a DoS (not enough volume), nor a scan (not enough ports/IPs targeted).

---

**In short:**  
*The flow matches the signature of a brute-force SSH attack—rapid, automated login attempts in a short burst directly to port 22.*


Explanation: 50

Let's break down the flow attributes and the possible reasoning behind labeling it as **""bruteForce""**:

---

### **Flow Attributes**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-21 13:21:41.256  
- **Duration:** 1.915 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 44763  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.4  
- **Dest port:** 22 (SSH)  
- **Packets:** 16  
- **Bytes:** 3659  
- **Flags:** .AP.SF  

---

### **Analysis**

#### **1. Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
- **Port 22** is the default port for SSH (Secure Shell), which is commonly targeted in brute-force attacks, where an attacker tries many username/password combinations to gain unauthorized access.

#### **2. Number of Packets and Bytes**
- **16 packets** and **3659 bytes** over about **2 seconds** is consistent with multiple rapid connection attempts or multiple authentication attempts within a single connection.  
- Not a huge data transfer (not a DoS), but enough to suggest interaction—possibly login attempts.

#### **3. TCP Flags: `.AP.SF`**
- The sequence of flags includes **A (ACK)**, **P (PSH)**, **S (SYN)**, **F (FIN)**.
- The presence of **SYN** suggests an active connection initiation, **ACK/PSH** for data exchange, and **FIN** for connection termination.
- The combination **.AP.SF** could indicate a full session:
  - **SYN**: Start connection
  - **ACK/PSH**: Data transfer (e.g., login attempts)
  - **FIN**: Normal connection close

#### **4. Source Port is High, Destination Port is 22**
- Indicates a client-initiated connection to an SSH server.

#### **5. Not ""DoS"" or ""Scan""**
- **DoS** would likely involve many more packets/bytes and possibly to other ports/services.
- **PortScan** or **PingScan** would have connections to multiple destination ports or ICMP, not just port 22.

---

### **Why ""bruteForce""?**

- **SSH brute-force attacks** involve repeated, rapid login attempts over SSH.
- The flow shows a short, active session to port 22, with enough packets/bytes to suggest multiple authentication attempts.
- The flow is not large enough to be a DoS, and it's not scanning multiple ports (which would be ""portScan"") or sending ICMP packets (which would be ""pingScan"").
- The pattern matches typical brute-force SSH attack signatures: high-frequency connections or login attempts to SSH.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute      | Value                 | Indicates...                                 |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Dest port      | 22                    | SSH service targeted                         |
| Packets/Bytes  | 16 / 3659             | Multiple interactions, likely logins         |
| Duration       | 1.915s                | Rapid, fits brute-force patterns             |
| TCP Flags      | .AP.SF                | Normal session (connect, data, close)        |
| Not DoS/Scan   | Only SSH, not flooding| Not DoS, not port/ping scan                  |

---

### **Conclusion**
**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it represents a short, active SSH connection with enough data exchanged to suggest multiple login attempts, matching the typical pattern of a brute-force SSH attack.**


Explanation: 51

Let’s analyze the flow details and the classification:

**Flow Attributes:**
- **Start Time:** 2017-03-20 11:14:29.635
- **Duration:** 0.0 (very short, probably a single packet)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source Port:** 59404
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Destination Port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 74
- **Flags:** ....S. (SYN only)

**Classification:**  
**""bruteForce""**

---

## Step-by-Step Reasoning

### 1. **Nature of the Connection**
- **TCP SYN Only:** The flow consists of a single TCP SYN packet (the start of a connection, no ACK or data).
- **No duration:** Indicates no handshake completion or data transfer.

### 2. **Targeted Port:**
- **Port 22:** SSH is a common target for brute-force attacks, where attackers attempt to guess user credentials by repeatedly connecting and trying different usernames/passwords.

### 3. **Single Packet:**
- Only one SYN packet is seen in this flow, possibly because each connection attempt is logged as a distinct flow. In many network monitoring systems, each TCP SYN attempt (even if not completed) is recorded as a separate flow.

### 4. **Brute Force Attack Pattern:**
- **Brute-force attacks** often involve repeated connection attempts to a login service (like SSH) from the same or different source ports. Each attempt might be a single SYN packet if the server rejects or rate-limits connections, or if the attacker is rapidly cycling through attempts.  
- If you have many such flows (single SYN to port 22 from the same source in a short time), this is a classic brute-force signature.

### 5. **Why Not Port Scan?**
- **Port scans** typically target multiple ports on a single host or a single port across many hosts. Here, the destination is always port 22, which fits SSH brute-force rather than general port scanning.

### 6. **Why Not DOS/PingScan?**
- **DoS:** Usually involves large numbers of packets, often with varied flags, not just SYN.
- **PingScan:** Involves ICMP, not TCP SYN to port 22.

---

## **Conclusion**

**Why classified as ""bruteForce"":**

- **Features matching brute-force:**  
  - TCP SYN to port 22 (SSH)
  - Single packet (possibly representing one login attempt)
  - If this pattern is repeated (many such flows), it matches brute-force login attempts commonly seen in SSH attacks.

**In short:**  
*This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a TCP SYN packet to the SSH port (22), which is a typical signature of an SSH brute-force attempt, especially when observed as part of a sequence of similar flows.* 

If you have a single flow, it's not enough for brute-force, but in datasets, each login attempt may be logged as a separate flow, and thus the label is applied per-flow.


Explanation: 52

Certainly! Let's break down the reasoning step by step based on the flow features and the possible labels:

## **Flow Attributes Recap**

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-20 12:15:50.915  
- **Duration:** 0.124 seconds (very short)
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source Port:** 60985  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.100.6  
- **Destination Port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 11  
- **Bytes:** 3049  
- **TCP Flags:** .AP.S. (ACK, PSH, SYN)  

## **Possible Labels**
- ""---"" : No attack, normal flow  
- ""dos"" : Denial of Service attack  
- ""portScan"": Port Scan attack  
- ""bruteForce"": Bruteforce attack  
- ""pingScan"": Ping Scan attack  

## **Analysis**

### 1. **Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
- Port 22 is the standard port for SSH, a common target for brute force attacks (attackers try many username/password combinations to gain access).

### 2. **Short Duration, Multiple Packets**
- The flow lasted only 0.124 seconds but sent **11 packets** and **3049 bytes**. This is a relatively high number of packets and bytes for such a short, targeted connection to an SSH port.

### 3. **TCP Flags: .AP.S.**
- The flags seen include **SYN** (start connection), **ACK** (acknowledge), and **PSH** (push data), which are typical in an interactive session (such as trying to log in). The sequence **.AP.S.** (meaning the flow included ACK, PSH, SYN at various points) suggests not just a simple connection test, but data was actively being sent—consistent with password attempts.

### 4. **Not a Scan**
- **Port scan** and **ping scan** attacks usually involve connecting to many different ports or IPs, often with SYN packets but not much data transfer. Here, the flow is to a *single* port (22) and includes data transfer, so it's not a scan.

### 5. **Not a DoS**
- **DoS** attacks usually involve a very high number of packets or bytes, often targeting service disruption. This flow doesn't have the high volume or repeated pattern characteristic of a DoS.

### 6. **Brute Force Criteria**
- The combination of:
  - Targeting SSH (port 22)
  - Short, repeated connections
  - Active data packets (suggesting login attempts)
  - Moderate number of packets/bytes (not just a SYN scan)
- This matches the typical signature of a **brute force attack**, where an attacker tries multiple password combinations in a short time.

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**

- The destination is port 22 (SSH), a common brute force target.
- The connection is short but involves multiple packets and data, suggesting multiple login attempts.
- The TCP flags indicate active data transfer, not just connection attempts.
- The flow doesn't match other attack types (e.g., DoS or scans).
- All these characteristics are consistent with someone rapidly trying to brute-force SSH credentials.

**In summary:**  
> **The flow matches a brute force SSH attack pattern: rapid, short-lived, data-carrying TCP connections to port 22, typical of automated login attempts.**


Explanation: 53

Let's break down the attributes of the network flow you provided:

#### Flow Attributes

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-20 10:28:52.411
- **Duration:** 1.0 second
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source Port:** 34367
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Destination Port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 2
- **Bytes:** 148
- **Flags:** ....S.

### What does the flow represent?

- **TCP SYN packet:**  
  The TCP flag is ""S"" (SYN), which means this connection is an attempt to initiate a new TCP session.
- **Destination Port 22:**  
  Port 22 is the default port for SSH, which is commonly targeted in brute force attacks.
- **Packets and Bytes:**  
  Only 2 packets and 148 bytes were transmitted, suggesting this is the initial handshake.

### Why classified as **""bruteForce""**?

#### 1. **Target Port (22/SSH):**
Brute force attacks commonly target SSH because it's a remote login service. Attackers try many different username/password combinations to gain access.

#### 2. **SYN Packet:**
The flow contains only a SYN packet (no ACK, no data transfer). Brute force SSH attacks often involve a high number of connection attempts (each starting with a SYN) from the attacker's host to the target's SSH port.

#### 3. **Pattern of Behavior (Implied):**
Even though this flow alone is just a SYN to port 22, in the context of **multiple such flows from the same source IP to port 22 on the same or different hosts**, it would indicate a brute force attack: rapid, repeated SSH connection attempts.

#### 4. **Why **not** other labels?**
- **DOS:** Not enough packets, and only one connection attempt, not a flood.
- **portScan:** Would likely hit many ports, not just 22.
- **pingScan:** Uses ICMP, not TCP.
- **Normal (""---""):** A single SYN to SSH could be normal, but in a dataset where attack flows are being flagged, a pattern of such flows would be brute force. The classifier might be seeing many such flows from the same source.

---

## **Conclusion**
**This flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a TCP SYN packet targeting SSH (port 22).**  
In the context of network attack detection, **a pattern of repeated such flows** (even if each flow is just an initial handshake) strongly suggests an automated brute force attempt to discover valid SSH credentials.

**Note:**  
On its own, a single SYN to port 22 is not sufficient evidence of brute force. The classification likely results from the flow being part of a larger sequence of similar flows from the same source to the same destination/service.

**If you have multiple such flows from the same source to port 22, this is a textbook sign of SSH brute force.**


Explanation: 54

Let's break down the network flow attributes and see why it might have been classified as **""bruteForce""**:

### Flow Attributes

| Attribute         | Value                    |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Start Time        | 2017-03-20 11:32:13.488 |
| Duration          | 0.0                     |
| Protocol          | TCP                     |
| Src IP            | 192.168.220.16          |
| Src Port          | 42305                   |
| Dest IP           | 192.168.200.8           |
| Dest Port         | 22.0                    |
| Packets           | 1                       |
| Bytes             | 74                      |
| Flags             | ....S.                  |

### Key Observations

- **Protocol: TCP**
  - Standard protocol for SSH (port 22).
- **Dest Port: 22**
  - This is the default port for the SSH service, which is a common target for brute force attacks.
- **Flags: ....S.**
  - Only the SYN flag is set, indicating the initiation of a TCP connection.
- **Packets: 1, Bytes: 74**
  - Only one packet, a SYN packet, was observed.
- **Duration: 0.0**
  - The flow lasted essentially no time; it is a single SYN packet.

### Interpretation

#### Why might this be a ""bruteForce"" label?

- **Brute Force attacks on SSH:**
  - Typically, brute force attacks on SSH involve repeatedly attempting to establish TCP connections to port 22, trying various username/password combinations.
  - Each attempt starts with a SYN packet to port 22.
  - If the detection system sees a large number of SYN packets from a single source to port 22 (possibly to different usernames), it may flag it as ""bruteForce"".
- **This Flow Alone:**
  - By itself, a *single* SYN packet to port 22 is not necessarily indicative of brute force. It could be part of normal SSH usage.
  - However, if this flow is part of a larger pattern (many similar flows from the same source in a short period), it could indicate brute force attempts.
  - Some network intrusion detection systems may label any attempt to connect to SSH with a SYN packet as ""bruteForce"" if it matches a signature or threshold.

### Possible Reason for Classification

- **Signature-Based Detection:**
  - The system may have a rule: **""Any TCP SYN packet to port 22 from an external or untrusted source is suspicious and could be brute force.""**
- **Threshold Not Shown:**
  - If you only see this one flow, but the classifier has seen others before or after it (not shown in your data), it may have detected a pattern.
- **False Positive:**
  - It's possible the classifier is a bit too aggressive, flagging any connection attempt to SSH as brute force.

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute        | Value         | Why Relevant for BruteForce?                   |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Protocol         | TCP          | Used by SSH                                   |
| Dest Port        | 22           | SSH service, common brute force target        |
| Flags            | SYN          | Start of a connection, typical for brute force|
| Packets          | 1            | Could be part of a sequence of attempts       |
| Duration         | 0.0          | Single attempt, but may be in a larger pattern|

---

## **In Summary:**
This flow was likely classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a TCP SYN packet attempting to initiate a connection to port 22 (SSH). In the context of intrusion detection, multiple such attempts in succession are a classic sign of SSH brute force attacks. The classifier may either be aggressive or have context not visible in this single flow.

**If you only see this single flow, it may be a false positive, but classifying SYN packets to SSH as brute force is a common practice in automated systems.**


Explanation: 55

Let’s break down the flow and the reasoning behind the **""bruteForce""** label.

### Flow Details Recap

| Attribute      | Value                    |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Start Time     | 2017-03-21 13:21:26.892  |
| Duration       | 0.164 seconds            |
| Protocol       | TCP                      |
| Src IP         | 192.168.200.4            |
| Src Port       | 22                       |
| Dest IP        | 192.168.220.16           |
| Dest Port      | 44757                    |
| Packets        | 11                       |
| Bytes          | 2085                     |
| TCP Flags      | .AP.S.                   |

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### 1. **Service Identification**
- **Src Port 22**: This is the default port for **SSH**.  
- **TCP Protocol**: SSH runs over TCP.

#### 2. **Flow Direction**
- The source is port 22, so the flow is from the SSH server (192.168.200.4) to a client (192.168.220.16:44757). This likely represents a *response* from the SSH server to a connection attempt.

#### 3. **Flags**
- **.AP.S.**: This means the flow saw packets with *ACK*, *PSH*, and *SYN* flags set at various points.
  - **SYN**: Used to initiate a TCP connection.
  - **ACK**: Acknowledge received data.
  - **PSH**: Push data to the receiving application.
- This indicates a connection was attempted and data was exchanged.

#### 4. **Packet and Byte Count**
- **11 packets, 2085 bytes** in 0.164 seconds: This is a **short, small flow**. Brute-force attacks often involve many rapid, short-lived connection attempts with small amounts of data as the attacker tries credentials.

#### 5. **Nature of Brute-Force Attacks**
- **Brute-force SSH attacks** typically involve repeatedly trying to log in with different username/password combinations. Each attempt creates a short-lived flow, often with the server immediately responding with ""login failed"" or equivalent.
- The pattern: **many short connections** to port 22 from the same or multiple IPs, with a small amount of data exchanged as credentials are tried.

#### 6. **Why Not Other Attacks?**
- **DoS**: Typically, would expect many packets, large data volumes, and possibly only SYN or SYN/ACK flags, not short, completed flows.
- **PortScan**: Would see many destination ports being probed, usually with SYN packets to various ports.
- **PingScan**: Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **Normal flow (""---"")**: Normal SSH flows are typically longer, with more packets and data (interactive session or file transfer).

### **Summary Table**

| Label       | Typical Characteristics                  | Matches This Flow? |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| ---         | Long duration, more data, normal use     | ❌                 |
| dos         | High packet count, high bandwidth        | ❌                 |
| portScan    | Many destination ports, short SYNs       | ❌                 |
| bruteForce  | Repeated short SSH flows, small data     | ✅                 |
| pingScan    | ICMP protocol, not TCP                   | ❌                 |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It is a short-lived TCP connection involving SSH (port 22).
- The flow exchanged a small number of packets/bytes, consistent with failed login attempts.
- The pattern (if seen repeatedly) matches brute-force SSH attack behavior, where an attacker tries multiple logins in rapid succession.

**If you saw many such flows in a short period, it would be a strong indicator of brute-force attempts against SSH.**

---

**In summary:**  
> The flow matches the typical characteristics of a brute-force SSH attack: repeated, short, unsuccessful login attempts over TCP to port 22 with small data transfers.


Explanation: 56

Let’s analyze the given flow details and classification:

**Flow Attributes:**
- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-20 11:27:16.781  
- **Duration:** 0.999 seconds (about 1 second)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source Port:** 36322
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Destination Port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 2
- **Bytes:** 148
- **Flags:** ....S. (Only SYN flag set)

**Classification:**  
*bruteForce* (Bruteforce attack)

---

## Why was this flow classified as ""bruteForce""?

### 1. **Destination Port: 22 (SSH)**
- Port 22 is used for SSH, which is a common target for brute force attacks where an attacker tries many password combinations to gain unauthorized access.

### 2. **TCP SYN Flag Only (....S.)**
- The only flag present is SYN, indicating an attempt to initiate a connection (part of the TCP three-way handshake).
- Multiple SYN packets to port 22 from the same or different sources in a short period can indicate an attempt to brute-force SSH login.

### 3. **Very Few Packets and Bytes**
- Only 2 packets and 148 bytes suggest this is a connection attempt, not a full session. This is typical for automated brute force tools, which may send many connection attempts with minimal data, especially if the server is rate-limiting or dropping further packets.

### 4. **Short Duration**
- The flow lasted < 1 second, which is consistent with rapid, repeated connection attempts.

### 5. **Behavior Profile**
- Brute force SSH attacks often show up as a large number of short-lived flows with SYN packets to port 22, usually with different source ports (to bypass rate-limiting), or from the same source IP.
- Although this is just one flow, in the context of many similar flows, this pattern is indicative of brute force attempts.

### 6. **Why Not Other Categories?**
- **""---"" (Normal):** Normal SSH traffic would typically show a completed handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), more packets, and possibly data transfer.
- **dos:** DOS would usually involve a high volume of packets/bytes, often to non-authentication ports, or with RST/ACK flags, and not just SYNs.
- **portScan:** A port scan would generally target multiple ports on the same host, not repeatedly target port 22.
- **pingScan:** Would use ICMP, not TCP.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute                | Value                 | Brute Force Attack Characteristic? |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Destination Port         | 22 (SSH)              | Yes                                |
| TCP Flag                 | SYN                   | Yes                                |
| Packet/Byte Count        | Low                   | Yes (implies repeated attempts)    |
| Duration                 | Short                 | Yes                                |
| Protocol                 | TCP                   | Yes (SSH uses TCP)                 |

---

### **In summary:**
This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it matches the typical pattern of automated SSH brute force attempts: short-lived TCP SYN attempts to port 22, with minimal data and packets, indicative of repeated unauthorized login tries rather than normal user sessions or other attack types.

---

**Note:** In real-world IDS/IPS, such a single flow alone may not be conclusive, but in labeled datasets, this pattern is often marked as ""bruteForce"" due to its match with brute force SSH attack characteristics.


Explanation: 57

Let's break down the flow details and why it was likely classified as **""bruteForce""**:

---

### 1. **Flow Details**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:01:51.091
- **Duration:** 0.005 seconds (5 milliseconds)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source port:** 35823
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.4
- **Destination port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 5
- **Bytes:** 610
- **TCP Flags:** `.AP..F` (ACK, PSH, FIN)

---

### 2. **Key Observations**

- **Destination Port 22:**  
  Port 22 is the default port for **SSH** (Secure Shell), which is a common target for brute-force attacks (attackers try many username/password combinations to gain access).

- **Short Duration, Multiple Packets:**  
  The connection lasted only **5 milliseconds** and transmitted **5 packets**. This suggests a short, possibly automated connection attempt.

- **TCP Flags `.AP..F`:**  
  This means the flow contains packets with **ACK**, **PSH**, and **FIN** flags set.  
  - **ACK/PSH** are used to deliver data (likely a login attempt/payload).
  - **FIN** means the sender wants to close the connection (possibly after an unsuccessful login).

- **Source Port High, Destination Port 22:**  
  The high source port (random, ephemeral) connecting to SSH is typical for client-to-server connections.

---

### 3. **Why Not Other Labels?**
- **""dos""**: Typically, a DoS attack is characterized by a large number of packets/bytes or many connections in a short time, aiming to exhaust resources. This flow is small and short-lived.
- **""portScan"" or ""pingScan""**:  
  - **PortScan:** Involves attempts to connect to many ports on a target. Here, only port 22 is targeted.
  - **PingScan:** Uses ICMP, not TCP.
- **""---"" (Normal):**  
  - Normal SSH use can look similar, but the short duration and pattern may match known brute-force behaviors, especially in dataset labeling.

---

### 4. **Why ""bruteForce""?**
- **SSH Target:** Brute-force attacks commonly target SSH.
- **Short, Repeated Connections:** Brute-force tools often make short lived connections, quickly sending login attempts and moving on.
- **Pattern Matching:** In labeled datasets, flows with a small number of packets, quick tear-downs, and connections to SSH are often labeled ""bruteForce,"" especially if seen in quick succession (not shown here, but common in attack datasets).

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute              | Value                         | BruteForce Indicator?                     |
|------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Destination port       | 22 (SSH)                     | High (SSH login target)                   |
| Duration               | 0.005s                       | Short-lived (common in automated attacks) |
| Packets                | 5                            | Low (short attempts)                      |
| TCP Flags              | .AP..F (ACK, PSH, FIN)       | Data + session close (login attempt)      |
| Bytes                  | 610                          | Consistent with login payloads            |

---

## **Conclusion**

**The flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It targets SSH (port 22), a service often attacked by brute-force login attempts.
- The flow is short and involves a small number of packets, indicating a likely automated login attempt.
- The TCP flags and pattern are consistent with a quick connection, data exchange (likely credentials), and immediate close—typical of brute-force tools.

**If there were many such flows in a short time from the same source to port 22, it would further confirm a brute-force attack.**

---

**In summary:**  
**This flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because it matches the signature of a rapid, automated SSH login attempt, which is the hallmark of brute-force attacks.**


Explanation: 58

Let's analyze the network flow attributes and explain why it could be classified as **""bruteForce""**.

### Flow Details

- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-20 12:36:53.898  
- **Duration:** 0.014 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source port:** 51099  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.100.4  
- **Destination port:** 22.0  (**SSH**)  
- **Packets:** 5  
- **Bytes:** 610  
- **Flags:** .AP..F

---

### Label Possibilities

- ""---"" : Normal flow
- ""dos"" : Denial of Service attack
- ""portScan"": Port Scan attack
- ""bruteForce"": Bruteforce attack
- ""pingScan"": Ping Scan attack

---

## **Step-by-Step Explanation**

### **1. Destination Port: 22 (SSH)**
Port 22 is used by SSH, a common target for brute-force attacks (repeated login attempts using different passwords).

### **2. Source Port is High (51099)**
This is typical of client-side ephemeral ports, nothing unusual.

### **3. Number of Packets and Bytes**
- **5 packets** and **610 bytes** in a very short duration (0.014 seconds).  
- This indicates a burst of activity: several packets sent quickly.

### **4. TCP Flags: `.AP..F`**
Let's decode the TCP flags:
- **A**: ACK (Acknowledgment)
- **P**: PSH (Push)
- **F**: FIN (Finish)

Pattern `.AP..F` suggests the following:
- This is not a new connection (no SYN)
- The flow involves data transfer (PSH/ACK), and the connection is being closed (FIN at the end)
- This matches a *data exchange* session, possibly a login attempt.

### **5. Duration**
- **0.014 seconds** is extremely short, suggesting the connection was quickly made and torn down.

### **6. Considering Attack Types**
- **DoS**: Usually has large numbers of packets/bytes or repeated connections to overwhelm service.
- **PortScan**: Would show many flows to different ports, not to port 22 specifically.
- **PingScan**: Would use ICMP, not TCP/22.
- **Normal**: Would typically have longer sessions for SSH (interactive), or more data if legitimate.
- **BruteForce**: Typically involves repeated, short-lived SSH connection attempts, often from the same source to port 22, with quick connect/disconnect patterns.

### **7. Why ""bruteForce""?**
- The flow targets SSH (port 22), which is a very common target for brute-forcing.
- The pattern (short connection, few packets, quick close) matches what you’d see when a bot/script tries to log in, possibly gets a rejection, and moves to the next attempt.
- If this flow is part of a sequence of similar flows (same source, same destination, port 22, short-lived), it is highly indicative of brute-force behavior.
- Not enough evidence for DoS (not enough volume), not a scan (only port 22), not a ping scan (wrong protocol), and not normal (too short, not enough data for a real SSH session).

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute       | Value             | Relevance to BruteForce Label          |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Dest Port       | 22 (SSH)          | SSH is a brute-force target            |
| Duration        | 0.014s            | Very short, matches failed login       |
| Packets/Bytes   | 5/610             | Few, typical for unsuccessful attempt  |
| Flags           | .AP..F            | Data sent, then connection closed      |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This network flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It is a very short-lived TCP connection to port 22 (SSH),
- Transmits a small amount of data (likely a login attempt),
- Closes quickly (indicative of failed attempt),
- This pattern is characteristic of brute-force SSH attacks, where automated scripts try to guess credentials by making many rapid-fire, short-lived connections.

**If there are multiple such flows in the data, this further strengthens the brute-force label.**

---

**In summary:**  
> The flow matches the typical behavior of a brute-force SSH attack: rapid, short-lived connections to port 22, with minimal data exchange and quick disconnection, which are hallmarks of automated password-guessing attempts.


Explanation: 59

Let's analyze your network flow and the classification:

### Network Flow Details

| Attribute        | Value                   |
|------------------|------------------------|
| **Start time**   | 2017-03-20 10:01:58.148|
| **Duration**     | 0.003 seconds          |

| **Flags**        | .AP..F                 |

### Classification: `bruteForce`
You said this flow was labeled as `bruteForce` (Bruteforce attack).

---

## **Explanation for BruteForce Classification**

### 1. **Destination Port: 22 (SSH)**
- Port 22 is the default port for SSH.
- SSH is a common target for brute force attacks, where an attacker tries to guess usernames and passwords by making repeated login attempts.

### 2. **Short Duration, Multiple Packets**
- The flow lasted only **0.003 seconds** but involved **5 packets**.
- High packet count in a very short time can indicate automated activity (like a script) rather than a human-initiated session.

### 3. **TCP Flags: `.AP..F`**
- **A**CK, **P**SH, **F**IN flags are set.
- This suggests the connection was established and data was pushed (likely a login attempt), then the connection was closed.
- No SYN at this point (meaning this is not the very first packet, but rather a data-carrying flow, possibly after handshake).

### 4. **Source Port is Ephemeral, Destination is SSH**
- The source port is a high ephemeral port, typical for client connections.
- Connecting to port 22 repeatedly with short sessions is a typical brute force pattern.

### 5. **No Evidence of DoS, Port Scan, or Ping Scan**
- **DoS**: Usually involves a very large number of packets/bytes or repeated connections to overwhelm a service.
- **PortScan/PingScan**: Usually involves connections to multiple ports/IPs, not just one.
- Here, the connection is specifically to the SSH port, not a range.

### 6. **BruteForce Pattern**
- Brute force SSH attacks are typically characterized by many short-lived connections to port 22, each trying a different password.
- This flow matches that pattern: a very short-lived SSH connection, data sent (likely a login attempt), and then closed.

## **Conclusion**

**This flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It targets port 22 (SSH), which is commonly attacked by brute force.
- It has a very short duration with a few packets and bytes, which is typical of automated login attempts.
- The TCP flags indicate a connection where data was exchanged and then promptly closed.
- It does not show characteristics of DoS (not enough volume), port scan (not enough ports), or ping scan (not ICMP).

**In summary:**  
*This flow fits the classic signature of an SSH brute force attempt—a short-lived, data-carrying session to port 22, likely representing a single password guess attempt.*


Explanation: 60

Let's break down the network flow and why it was classified as **""bruteForce""**:

#### **Flow Attributes**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:02:24.537  
- **Duration:** 1.719 seconds
- **Proto:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.200.4
- **Src port:** 22 (**SSH**)
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Dest port:** 36521
- **Packets:** 16
- **Bytes:** 2547
- **Flags:** .AP.SF

---

### **Analysis**

#### **1. Protocol and Ports**
- **Source port 22** is the default port for **SSH (Secure Shell)**.
- The destination port is a high, ephemeral port (36521) – likely the client-side port.

#### **2. Flow Direction**
- This flow is from **192.168.200.4:22** (an SSH server) to **192.168.220.16:36521** (a client).
- This suggests the flow is from server **to** client, probably as part of a session initiated by the client.

#### **3. TCP Flags**
- **.AP.SF** is a sequence of TCP flags seen in the flow (concatenation):
  - **A**: ACK (Acknowledgment)
  - **P**: PSH (Push)
  - **S**: SYN (Synchronize)
  - **F**: FIN (Finish)
- This sequence suggests the connection was established (SYN), data was transferred (PSH, ACK), and the connection was closed (FIN).

#### **4. Number of Packets and Duration**
- **16 packets** over **1.719 seconds**.
- **2547 bytes**—not a lot of data.

#### **5. Attack Type Reasoning**

##### **Why not DoS or Port Scan?**
- **DoS**: Typically involves a large number of packets, often to overwhelm the service. Here, only 16 packets.
- **PortScan/PingScan**: Would involve many destination ports or ICMP packets. Here, the communication is with a single host and port.

##### **Why not Normal?**
- The fact that port 22 (SSH) is involved and the flow is short with a small amount of data could be normal for an SSH session. However, in attack detection datasets, **brute force attacks** are often characterized by:
  - Repeated short-lived SSH connections (failed login attempts).
  - Multiple connection attempts from a client to port 22.
  - Low data transfer per connection (since logins fail and sessions are closed quickly).

##### **Why Brute Force?**
- In typical **brute force SSH attacks**, an attacker tries many password guesses in rapid succession, resulting in multiple short SSH sessions with little data transferred per session.
- The flow here matches that pattern:
  - **Short duration**
  - **Low data volume**
  - **Port 22 (SSH) involved**
  - The flow is not long enough nor does it transmit much data, suggesting it is not a legitimate session but a likely failed authentication attempt.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute      | Value                      | Brute Force Reasoning                                   |
|----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Proto          | TCP                        | SSH (port 22) uses TCP                                  |
| Src port       | 22                         | SSH service                                             |

| Flags          | .AP.SF                     | SYN, ACK, PSH, FIN: session setup, data, then closed   |

---

### **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It is a short-lived SSH connection (port 22) with minimal data transfer, typical of automated brute force attacks trying to guess SSH passwords. In such attacks, each failed attempt results in a short flow like this. The attributes match the profile of brute force activity much more than normal usage or other attack types.**

---

**If you have multiple such flows from the same source to port 22, it would further strengthen the brute force classification.**


Explanation: 61

Let's break down the provided network flow information and see why it would be classified as **""bruteForce""**:

---

### **Network Flow Details**

- **Start Time**: 2017-03-20 10:03:05.747
- **Duration**: 0.124 seconds (124 ms)
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Source IP/Port**: 192.168.220.16:37197
- **Destination IP/Port**: 192.168.200.4:22 (SSH)
- **Packets**: 11
- **Bytes**: 3049
- **TCP Flags**: .AP.S. (ACK, PSH, SYN)

---

### **Explanation**

#### **1. Destination Port = 22 (SSH)**
- Port 22 is typically used for **SSH**, which is a common target for brute force attacks (automated attempts to guess SSH login credentials).

#### **2. Number of Packets and Bytes in Short Duration**
- 11 packets and 3049 bytes transmitted in just 0.124 seconds is relatively high volume for such a short-lived SSH connection, suggesting automated activity rather than a legitimate user session.

#### **3. TCP Flags: .AP.S.**
- The flags present are **ACK, PSH, SYN**:
  - **SYN**: Initiates a connection.
  - **ACK**: Acknowledges received data.
  - **PSH**: Pushes data to the receiving application.
- The presence of **SYN** and **PSH/ACK** in a short flow may indicate multiple rapid connection attempts or quick data submission—behavior consistent with brute force tools.

#### **4. Short Duration**
- The session lasted only 0.124 seconds, which is unusually short for a legitimate SSH session, but typical of failed login attempts or automated attack scripts.

#### **5. Context: Not Port Scan, DOS, Ping Scan, or Normal**
- **Port Scan**: Would usually involve many destination ports, not just port 22.
- **DoS**: Would involve much higher packet/byte rate and possibly multiple destinations or repeated flooding.
- **Ping Scan**: Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **Normal**: A legitimate SSH session would generally last longer (unless immediately rejected), and would not have such a rapid burst of packets.

### **Summary Table**

| Label         | Reason for Exclusion                                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| ---           | Flow is not typical of a normal SSH session                  |
| dos           | Not enough traffic for denial of service; only one port      |
| portScan      | Only port 22 targeted, not multiple ports                    |
| pingScan      | Not ICMP protocol                                            |
| bruteForce    | Multiple packets, short duration, SSH port, typical pattern  |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It targets SSH (port 22), a common brute force target.
- There are multiple packets and bytes in a very short session, suggesting repeated login attempts.
- The TCP flags and traffic pattern are consistent with automated brute force tools.
- The behavior does **not** match normal SSH usage, nor does it fit the patterns for DoS, port scanning, or ping scanning.

**Such short, intense bursts of SSH traffic are a hallmark of brute force attacks, where tools try as many login combinations as possible in a short time.**


Explanation: 62

Let’s break down the flow attributes and explain **why it was classified as ""bruteForce""**:

---

### 1. **Source and Destination Ports**
- **Src port: 22**  
  - **Port 22** is the default port for **SSH (Secure Shell)**.
- **Dest port: 45538**  
  - This is a high, likely ephemeral port on the destination.

---

### 2. **Protocol**
- **TCP**  
  - Brute force attacks typically use TCP, especially for services like SSH.

---

### 3. **Flags: .AP.S.**
- **A**: ACK (Acknowledgment)
- **P**: PSH (Push)
- **S**: SYN (Synchronize)
- The flags string indicates a mix of connection setup (**SYN**), data transfer (**PSH, ACK**), and possibly other activity.

---

### 4. **Duration, Packets, Bytes**
- **Duration: 0.157 seconds**
- **Packets: 11**
- **Bytes: 2085**
- This is a short connection with a small amount of data, but enough to suggest an actual login attempt rather than a simple port scan.

---

### 5. **Attack Type Analysis**
#### Why **not** the other labels?
- **""dos"" (Denial of Service):**  
  - Usually involves a high amount of traffic in a short time, aiming to overwhelm a service—this doesn't match (only 11 packets, 2085 bytes).
- **""portScan"":**  
  - Would typically show connections to **many different ports**, not just one (here, only port 22 is used as the source).
- **""pingScan"":**  
  - Would involve ICMP protocol, not TCP.
- **""---"" (Normal):**  
  - There are some red flags: connection to SSH port from what might be a non-standard port, short duration, and possible login attempts.

---

### 6. **Why ""bruteForce""?**
- **SSH brute force attacks** are characterized by repeated login attempts to SSH (port 22) from various source ports.
- The **source port is 22** (unusual for a client) and the destination port is high (ephemeral), which can happen with certain attack tools or misconfigured scripts.
- The short duration and moderate packet count suggest an **automated attempt to login**.
- The presence of **SYN, ACK, and PSH flags** suggests:
    - Connection initiation (SYN)
    - Data exchange (ACK, PSH) — likely a password attempt.
- In some datasets and IDS systems, **flows from port 22 to high-numbered ports** or vice versa with these characteristics are often labeled as **brute force** because they fit the pattern of **automated login attempts**.

---

## **Summary**
**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it shows a short-lived TCP connection involving SSH, with evidence of a login attempt. The packet/byte count and the flag combination are consistent with an automated (and likely unsuccessful) SSH login, which is the hallmark of brute force attacks.**

Explanation: 63

Let's break down **why this network flow might have been classified as ""bruteForce""** based on the provided attributes.

---

### **Flow Attributes Recap**

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 12:39:33.614  
- **Duration:** 0.006 seconds (very short)
- **Proto:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.100.4
- **Src port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Dest port:** 52255 (ephemeral/high port)
- **Packets:** 5
- **Bytes:** 462
- **Flags:** .AP..F (ACK, PSH, FIN)

---

### **Step-by-Step Analysis**

#### **1. Source and Destination Ports**

- **Src port 22**: This is the well-known port for SSH (Secure Shell).
- **Dest port 52255**: A random high port, possibly the client side.

In SSH brute force attacks, an attacker tries to connect repeatedly to port 22 (SSH) with various username/password combinations, usually from different source ports.

#### **2. Duration**

- **0.006 seconds**: Extremely short. This suggests a quick communication attempt, possibly a connection attempt followed by immediate closure.

#### **3. Packet and Byte Count**

- **5 packets, 462 bytes**: Low numbers, which could indicate the connection was not fully established or was quickly terminated after an attempt.

#### **4. TCP Flags: .AP..F**

- **A (ACK)**: Acknowledgment
- **P (PSH)**: Push, indicating data is being sent immediately
- **F (FIN)**: Finish, indicating the end of the connection

This sequence (.AP..F) suggests:
- There was some data sent (PSH), acknowledged (ACK), and then the connection was closed (FIN).

#### **5. Attack Type Characteristics**

- **Brute-force attack:** 
  - Multiple short-lived connections to a service (here, SSH on port 22), often with failed logins.
  - Typically, each attempt is very short, with only a few packets exchanged before the connection is closed.

---

### **Why ""bruteForce""?**

- **SSH port (22) is targeted:** This is a prime target for brute-force password guessing.
- **Short-lived connection:** The duration is very short, with only a handful of packets, typical of an automated brute-force attempt.
- **Flags indicate a connection with data transmission and quick closure:** The .AP..F sequence is consistent with a login attempt (sending credentials) and the connection being immediately closed (either due to failure or automation).
- **Not a DoS (low packet/byte count, no volume/frequency info), not a scan (single port targeted), not a ping scan (not ICMP):**
    - **DoS:** Would usually involve many more packets and longer/larger flows.
    - **PortScan:** Would involve attempts to many destination ports, but here only port 22 is targeted.
    - **PingScan:** Would involve ICMP, not TCP.
    - **Normal:** This pattern (short, repeated, data-sending connection to SSH) is **not normal** for legitimate usage, especially if repeated.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute        | Value                | Relevance to Brute Force           |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| Protocol         | TCP                  | SSH runs over TCP                  |
| Src Port         | 22 (SSH)             | Target service for brute force     |
| Duration         | 0.006 sec            | Short-lived, typical of automated attempts |
| Packets/Bytes    | 5/462                | Low, fits single failed login      |
| Flags            | .AP..F               | Data sent, then immediate close    |
| Dest Port        | 52255 (client)       | High port, client side             |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow is classified as ""bruteForce""** because it matches the typical pattern of a brute-force SSH login attempt:  
- **Very short connection**
- **Low packet/byte count**
- **Data sent**
- **Connection closed quickly**
- **Target is SSH port (22)**

If many such flows are seen in a short time from the same source, it would strongly confirm brute-force activity.

---

**If you have further context (such as many flows like this from the same source), it would strengthen the bruteForce classification.**


Explanation: 64

Let's carefully analyze the provided network flow and why it was classified as **""bruteForce""**:

---

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-20 12:39:48.482
- **Duration:** 0.003 seconds
- **Proto:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Src port:** 52423
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.100.4
- **Dest port:** 22.0 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 5
- **Bytes:** 610
- **Flags:** .AP..F

---

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. **Destination Port: 22 (SSH)**
- **SSH (port 22)** is a common target for brute force attacks where an attacker repeatedly tries different username/password combinations to gain access.

### 2. **TCP Flags: `.AP..F`**
- Represents: **ACK**, **PSH**, and **FIN** flags set in the flow.
- This pattern (ACK, PSH, FIN) is typical for a completed TCP session with data transfer (PSH), an acknowledgement (ACK), and session finish (FIN).

### 3. **Short Duration, Small Number of Packets**
- **Duration:** 0.003 seconds (very short)
- **Packets:** 5
- **Bytes:** 610
- Indicates a very brief connection, likely an automated/scripted session rather than a human, which is common in brute force attacks where connections are quickly made and closed.

### 4. **Normal vs. Attack Traffic**
- **Normal Flow (""---""):** Would usually involve longer sessions, more data, and not so many rapid, short connections to SSH.
- **PortScan / PingScan:** Would involve many different **destination ports** or **ICMP traffic**, not repeated logins to a single port (22/SSH).
- **DoS:** Would have a larger volume of traffic or many packets/bytes in a short time, usually to overwhelm a service.

### 5. **BruteForce Attack Characteristics**
- **Brute force attacks on SSH:**
    - Typically involve many short-lived TCP connections to port 22 from the same or different source IPs.
    - Each connection tries a different password, fails, and closes quickly.
    - The `.AP..F` flags show connection establishment, data (attempted login), and closure.
    - The small packet/byte count matches a failed attempt (login prompt, credential sent, denied, connection closed).

## **Summary Table**

| Label         | Why Not This?                                                        |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ""---""         | Unusual short, automated SSH session, not typical normal behavior.   |
| ""dos""         | No high volume of traffic to overwhelm, just 5 packets, 610 bytes.  |
| ""portScan""    | Only port 22 targeted, not a range of ports.                        |
| ""pingScan""    | Not ICMP, this is TCP to SSH.                                       |
| **""bruteForce""** | **Fits pattern: short, repeated SSH attempts, quick connect/disconnect.** |

---

## **Final Explanation**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a short-lived TCP connection to SSH (port 22) with a typical sequence of data transfer and session closure flags (ACK, PSH, FIN). These characteristics are consistent with an automated brute force attack attempting to guess credentials, rather than normal usage, denial of service, or scanning activity.**


Explanation: 65

Let's break down the information you provided and see why this network flow might be classified as **""bruteForce""**:

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-20 12:37:28.169  
- **Duration:** 0.126 seconds (very short)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source port:** 51442
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.100.4
- **Destination port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 11
- **Bytes:** 3049
- **Flags:** .AP.S. (ACK, PSH, SYN)

### What is a Brute Force Attack?
A brute force attack, in the context of network flows, usually refers to repeated attempts to gain access to a service (often SSH, RDP, FTP, etc.) by systematically trying many passwords or keys in rapid succession.

### Key Indicators in This Flow

1. **Destination Port 22 (SSH):**  
   Port 22 is almost always used for Secure Shell (SSH) access. SSH is a very common target for brute force attacks because attackers try to guess usernames and passwords to gain access.

2. **Short Duration, Multiple Packets:**  
   The flow lasted only **0.126 seconds**, but **11 packets** and **3049 bytes** were exchanged. This suggests rapid communication, likely failed login attempts or authentication negotiation.

3. **Source Port is High, Destination Port is SSH:**  
   The source port is ephemeral (51442), which is normal for a client. The destination is specifically targeting SSH.

4. **TCP Flags: .AP.S.**  
   - **SYN (S):** Start of TCP connection (normal for new connections)
   - **ACK (A) and PSH (P):** Indicates data transfer, possibly login attempts.
   - The absence of FIN or RST suggests the connection may have been dropped or abruptly reset (common in failed logins/rapid retries).

5. **Flow Features Consistent with BruteForce:**  
   - **Single source, single destination, repeated connections, short duration, and targeting an authentication service.**
   - In many intrusion detection systems, if a host rapidly makes multiple connections to port 22 with several packets in a short time, it's a classic signature of SSH brute force.

### Why **not** other attack types?

- **""dos"":** DOS usually involves a very large number of packets or bytes, often to ports/services that can be overwhelmed. This flow is small and targeted.
- **""portScan""/""pingScan"":**  
  - Port scan: Multiple ports are targeted, not just one (here, only port 22).
  - Ping scan: Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **""---"" (Normal):**  
  - A normal SSH flow would likely have a longer duration (for a full session), or fewer packets for a single connection attempt. The pattern here suggests rapid, automated, likely unauthorized attempts.

---

## **Summary**
The flow is classified as **""bruteForce""** because:
- It targets SSH (port 22), a common brute force target.
- It involves rapid, multiple packets within a very short duration, suggesting automated login attempts.
- The TCP flags and flow characteristics match failed/rapid connection attempts rather than a normal user session.
- No evidence of port scanning or denial of service is present.

**In short:**  
*This flow matches the signature of an automated brute force attack against an SSH server, attempting multiple logins in a short burst from one source IP to one destination IP and port.*


Explanation: 66

Let's break down the attributes of your network flow and explain why it **was classified as ""bruteForce""**.

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Start Time**: 2017-03-20 10:02:44.727
- **Duration**: 0.008 seconds (8 milliseconds)
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Source IP/Port**: 192.168.220.16:36547
- **Destination IP/Port**: 192.168.200.4:22
- **Packets**: 5
- **Bytes**: 610
- **Flags**: .AP..F

### Key Points

#### 1. **Destination Port 22**
- Port 22 is the default port for **SSH** (Secure Shell), which is commonly a target for brute-force attacks (i.e., repeated attempts to guess username/password logins).

#### 2. **Short Duration, Multiple Packets**
- The flow is extremely short (8 ms), but within that time, **5 packets** and **610 bytes** were exchanged. This suggests a burst of activity, consistent with rapid login attempts or failed authentication exchanges.

#### 3. **TCP Flags: .AP..F**
- Decoding:  
  - **A** = ACK (Acknowledgement)
  - **P** = PSH (Push)
  - **F** = FIN (Finish)
- Sequence: 
  - The absence of SYN means this is not the initial handshake but data transfer and a connection close.
  - The presence of **PSH** and **ACK** usually indicates data is being sent and acknowledged.
  - **FIN** means the connection is closed at the end.
- This flag sequence is typical of a short-lived TCP session where some data is sent and then the connection is closed quickly.

#### 4. **Not a Scan**
- **PortScan** and **PingScan** typically involve multiple destination ports or ICMP echo requests, which is not the case here: single destination port (22) and protocol is TCP.

#### 5. **Not DoS**
- **DoS** (Denial of Service) typically involves a much higher number of packets and bytes, or repeated attempts to flood a service. Here, the flow is short and limited in packets.

#### 6. **BruteForce Indicators**
- Repeated, very short, and rapid attempts to connect to an SSH server are a classic symptom of a brute-force attack, where an attacker tries many password guesses in a short time.
- Individual brute-force login attempts often result in short flows with failed logins, matching your flow's profile.

---

### **Conclusion: Why ""bruteForce""?**

- **Destination Port 22**: Targeting SSH, a common brute-force target.
- **Short Burst of Packets**: 5 packets in 8 ms suggests a fast attempt, typical of automated scripts.
- **TCP Flags**: Indicates a brief connection with some data, then a close—consistent with a failed login attempt.
- **Pattern**: This flow, if seen as part of a series from the same source, would strongly indicate brute-force activity.

#### **Thus:**
Your flow was classified as **""bruteForce""** because it matches the typical pattern of an SSH brute-force attack: a rapid, short-lived connection to port 22, with data exchange and then an immediate close. These are the ""footprints"" of automated login attempts.

---

**If you have multiple such flows from the same source to port 22, the evidence for brute-force increases even further.**


Explanation: 67

Let’s break down the flow and the label **""bruteForce""** in detail:

### 1. **Flow Attributes**
- **Src IP:** 192.168.100.4
- **Src Port:** 22 (**SSH**)
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Dest Port:** 51395 (ephemeral, high port)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Packets:** 5
- **Bytes:** 462
- **Flags:** `.AP..F` (ACK, PSH, FIN)
- **Duration:** 0.027 seconds

### 2. **Understanding the Context**
- **Source Port 22:** This strongly suggests the server is sending data **from** the SSH service (default port for SSH).
- **Destination Port 51395:** A high, likely random port, suggesting the client side of a connection.
- **Direction:** The flow is likely from the SSH server to a client.

### 3. **Behavior Analysis**
- **Short Duration, Few Packets:** This is a very **short-lived** connection (27ms, 5 packets).
- **TCP Flags `.AP..F`:**  
  - **A**CK: Acknowledgment of receipt.
  - **P**SH: Data push (data sent to the application layer immediately).
  - **F**IN: Connection termination request.
  - **No SYN:** This is **not** the initial handshake; the flow is part of an established connection.

### 4. **Why ""bruteForce""?**
- **SSH Brute Force Attacks:** These attacks involve an adversary attempting to guess credentials by making repeated, rapid connection attempts to an SSH server (port 22), often causing many **short, failed** connections.
- **Indicators in This Flow:**
  - **Source port 22:** The server is responding, possibly with an error or disconnect message.
  - **Very short connection:** Brute force attempts usually result in quick disconnects after login failure.
  - **Small number of packets/bytes:** Typical for rejected or failed authentication attempts.
  - **Non-standard destination port:** A legitimate SSH session would usually be initiated to port 22, not from it. Seeing flows **from** port 22 to many random high ports is a telltale sign of **unsuccessful inbound connection attempts**.
- **No evidence of SYN scan or DoS:** No large volume, no repeated destination port changes, and no ICMP (so not a ping scan).

### 5. **Summary Table:**
| Feature                     | Observation                 | BruteForce Indicator?          |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Source port                 | 22 (SSH)                    | Yes (server responding)        |
| Destination port            | High, random                | Yes (ephemeral client port)    |
| Packets/Bytes               | Very low                    | Yes (failed login, short conn) |
| Duration                    | Very short                  | Yes                            |
| TCP Flags                   | .AP..F                      | Yes (data, then disconnect)    |
| Attack pattern              | Short, failed SSH           | Yes                            |

---

## **Conclusion**
This flow is classified as **""bruteForce""** **because**:
- It is a short, unsuccessful SSH connection, with the server (port 22) sending a small amount of data and quickly terminating the session—**consistent with a failed brute-force login attempt** (possibly as part of a larger pattern of many such flows).
- The pattern matches how brute force attacks generate many quick, failed logins on SSH, each resulting in small, terminated flows like this.
- No signs of other attack types (no port sweep, no DoS patterns, no ICMP).

---

**In short:**  
> The flow’s very short-lived, low-volume, server-initiated SSH traffic (from port 22) with immediate termination is characteristic of a brute-force attack attempting and quickly failing to authenticate.


Explanation: 68

Let's break down the features of your network flow and analyze why it might have been classified as **""bruteForce""**:

---

## **Flow Attributes:**

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:44:14.749  
- **Duration:** 0.0 (very short; likely a single packet)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Src port:** 38204
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Dest port:** 22.0 (**SSH**)
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 74
- **Flags:** ....S. (**SYN flag set**)

---

## **Interpretation:**

### **What the flow shows**
- **Single TCP SYN packet** from **192.168.220.16** to **192.168.200.8** on port **22** (SSH)
- **Flow duration is zero**; no further communication (no ACK, no data, only SYN).
- This is the initial step of establishing a TCP connection.

---

### **Why was it classified as ""bruteForce""?**

#### **Possible Reasoning:**
- **Brute force attacks** on SSH are extremely common. They involve repeatedly attempting to connect to the SSH service (port 22) in order to guess the password.
- **Network flow-based classifiers** often look for patterns such as:
    - **Repeated SYN packets to port 22** from the same or different source IPs.
    - **Numerous short-lived connections** (many flows with duration 0 or 1 packet).
    - **No successful completion of the handshake** (only SYNs, no ACKs or data).
- **This specific flow** is a **single SYN** to port 22 (SSH), which **on its own** is **not enough to definitively prove brute force**. However, if your classifier is trained on a dataset where *many similar flows* indicate a brute force attempt (because attackers try many passwords by starting new connections each time), then **even a single such flow can be labeled as ""bruteForce""**.

#### **Why not another label?**
- **""dos"" (Denial of Service):** Usually involves many packets, often to multiple ports, or large numbers of SYNs (SYN flood), not just a single SYN.
- **""portScan"":** Usually involves connecting to many ports on the same host.
- **""pingScan"":** Uses ICMP protocol, not TCP.
- **""---"" (No attack):** A single SYN is also normal, but in an attack-labeled dataset, one SYN to port 22 may be considered brute force if in context with other similar flows.

---

## **Summary Table:**

| Feature      | Value           | Brute Force Relevance                   |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Dest Port    | 22 (SSH)        | Common brute force target                |
| TCP Flags    | SYN only        | Start of connection, typical for brute force attempts |
| Packets      | 1               | Short/failed connection, common in brute force |
| Duration     | 0.0             | Immediate disconnect, typical attack pattern |
| Protocol     | TCP             | SSH uses TCP                             |

---

## **Conclusion:**

**This flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It is a TCP SYN packet to the SSH port (22), which is a common target for brute force attacks.
- The flow is short-lived (1 packet, no handshake), matching the signature of brute force attempts where many connection attempts are made rapidly.
- The classifier likely sees this pattern (especially in context with many similar flows) as indicative of brute force.

**Note:** In practice, a single SYN to port 22 could be benign, but if your dataset or classifier labels all such events as brute force (perhaps based on attack simulation data), this is why it gets this label.

---

**If you have more flows like this from the same source IP to port 22, this would strongly confirm brute forcing behavior.**  
**If this is a lone event, it could be an overzealous classification, but this is common in labeled attack datasets.**


Explanation: 69

Let's break down the network flow and explain **why it was classified as a ""bruteForce"" attack**:

---

### **Flow Details**

- **Time & Duration:**  
  *Start*: 2017-03-21 13:20:04.297  
  *Duration*: 1.503 seconds

- **Protocol:**  
  *TCP*

- **Source:**  
  *IP:* 192.168.220.16  
  *Port:* 44717

- **Destination:**  
  *IP:* 192.168.200.4  
  *Port:* 22.0 (SSH)

- **Packets:** 18  
- **Bytes:** 3791

- **TCP Flags:** `.AP.SF`  
  *(ACK, PSH, SYN, FIN appear in the flow)*

---

### **Analysis**

#### **1. Destination Port 22**

- **Port 22** is the default port for **SSH**, a service commonly targeted for brute force attacks (where attackers try multiple username/password combinations to gain access).

#### **2. Number of Packets and Duration**

- **18 packets** and **3791 bytes** over **1.5 seconds** is a relatively high activity for a single flow toward an SSH port (especially if repeated or part of a pattern).
- In brute force attacks, the attacker sends multiple authentication attempts in rapid succession.

#### **3. TCP Flags**

- **Flags:** `.AP.SF`
  - **A**CK: Acknowledgment
  - **P**SH: Push function (data sent to application)
  - **S**YN: Synchronize (start connection)
  - **F**IN: Finish (close connection)
- The presence of **SYN** and **FIN** within the same flow indicates connection establishment and termination. The **ACK** and **PSH** suggest data was sent (likely authentication attempts).
- In brute force attempts, you'll see connections being rapidly established, data sent (login attempts), and then closed.

#### **4. Flow Context**

- **SSH brute force attacks** are characterized by:
  - Many short-lived TCP connections to port 22
  - Multiple data exchanges (packets/bytes) per connection
  - Repeated failed login attempts (not visible here, but often inferred from packet counts/timing)

#### **5. Why Not Other Labels?**

- **dos (Denial of Service):** Would involve a much larger volume of packets/bytes, often to various ports/services, with the goal of service disruption, not authentication.
- **portScan:** Would involve connections to many different ports, not just 22.
- **pingScan:** Would use ICMP protocol, not TCP.
- **No attack:** This is unlikely given the protocol, destination, and flow activity.

---

### **Conclusion**

**This flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**

- It targets SSH (port 22), a common brute force target.
- The packet and byte counts, combined with the presence of data packets and connection establishment/termination, fit the pattern of repeated SSH login attempts.
- The activity is consistent with automated tools trying multiple logins in a short period.

**In summary:**  
> The network flow shows repeated, short-lived SSH connections from a single source to port 22, with data exchanged in each session—exactly the behavior expected from a brute force attack script trying to guess SSH credentials.

Explanation: 70

Let's analyze the flow details and the ""bruteForce"" label assignment:

**Flow Attributes:**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:46:36.154  
- **Duration:** 0.997 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 39195  
- **Dst IP:** 192.168.200.8  
- **Dst port:** 22.0 (SSH)  
- **Packets:** 2  
- **Bytes:** 148  
- **Flags:** ....S. (Only SYN flag set)

---

## Initial Observations

- **Destination port 22 (SSH):** This is the standard port for SSH, which is a common target for brute-force login attempts.
- **TCP Flags:** Only the SYN flag is set. This indicates that this flow represents an attempt to initiate a TCP connection, not a completed connection.
- **Very short flow (2 packets, 148 bytes):** This suggests a connection attempt rather than a sustained data transfer.

---

## Why ""bruteForce""?

### 1. **Brute-force attacks on SSH**
- Attackers often target port 22 with repeated login attempts, trying many username/password combinations in a short time.
- Each attempt typically starts with a SYN packet to establish a new TCP connection to port 22.

### 2. **Single SYN Packet**
- The presence of only a SYN flag suggests that this is (likely) just the beginning of a connection attempt.
- In the absence of further packets (such as those containing actual login data), a single SYN to port 22 could be part of a bruteforce campaign, where the attacker rapidly and repeatedly tries to connect.

### 3. **How Brute-force Labeling Works**
- **Bruteforce detection algorithms** often look for:
  - Multiple connection attempts to authentication services (SSH, RDP, etc.) from the same source in a short time.
  - Flows that are very short (often just SYN or SYN/ACK), as failed attempts rarely complete the handshake or send much data.
- **In context:** If this flow is one of many from the same source to port 22 within a short window, it's highly suspicious for brute-force.

---

## Why Not Another Label?

- **Not ""dos"":** DOS attacks typically involve many packets, high bandwidth, or repeated attempts to overwhelm a service—not just SYN packets to SSH.
- **Not ""portScan"":** Port scans usually involve connection attempts to many different ports, not repeated attempts to the same port (22).
- **Not ""pingScan"":** Would involve ICMP, not TCP SYN to port 22.
- **Not ""---"" (Normal):** Repeated SYNs to SSH from the same source are abnormal and often malicious.

---

## **Conclusion**

**The flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It is a TCP SYN attempt to port 22 (SSH).
- Brute-force attacks on SSH often manifest as many short-lived flows (SYNs) from the same source trying to log in.
- This flow matches that pattern (even if it's just one, the overall context probably includes many such flows).
- The attributes (short duration, low bytes, SYN flag) are typical of brute-force login attempts.

**If you saw many such flows from the same source to port 22, this would almost certainly be a brute-force attack pattern.**

---

**Summary Table:**

| Attribute           | Value                 | BruteForce Indicator?         |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Protocol            | TCP                  | Yes                           |
| Destination Port    | 22                   | Yes (SSH)                     |
| TCP Flags           | SYN only             | Yes (connection attempts)     |
| Packets/Bytes       | Very low             | Yes (failed/incomplete login) |
| Duration            | < 1s                 | Yes                           |
| Repetition (implied)| Often many such flows| Yes                           |

**Therefore, the flow fits a brute-force SSH attack profile.**


Explanation: 71

Let's analyze your network flow and the classification of **""bruteForce""** step by step:

---

### **Flow Attributes:**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 11:00:12.804  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 52291  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.8  
- **Dest port:** 22.0  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 74  
- **Flags:** ....S. (Only SYN is set)

---

### **What happened in this flow?**

- **A single TCP SYN packet** was sent from 192.168.220.16:52291 to 192.168.200.8:22.
- **No response** is shown (duration 0.0, 1 packet, only SYN flag), so likely this is just an attempted connection.
- **Port 22** is the default for SSH.

---

## **Why ""bruteForce""?**

### **Brute Force Attacks** (in network flow context)
A brute force attack, especially against SSH (port 22), typically involves **repeated login attempts** in an attempt to guess usernames and passwords.

However, this flow **only shows a single SYN packet** (an attempt to start a TCP connection, likely for SSH).

---

### **Why might a single SYN packet be labeled as brute force?**

There are several possible explanations:

1. **Flow-based labeling is often applied to groups of flows.**  
   If you are running a flow-based IDS (Intrusion Detection System), sometimes the label is assigned not per individual packet but to all flows between a source and target during a period in which brute force activity was detected.  
   - *For example*: If 192.168.220.16 made many SSH connection attempts to 192.168.200.8 (port 22) in a short timeframe, the **whole set** of flows might be labeled ""bruteForce"" in the dataset.

2. **This flow is one part of a larger pattern.**  
   This SYN packet may be **one of many similar flows** from the same source to the same destination/port; the labeling is applied because the **pattern of many such attempts** is characteristic of brute force attacks.

3. **Dataset labeling error or artifact.**  
   In some labeled datasets, especially in academic or generated datasets, **all flows from a known attacker during the attack window** are labeled with the attack type, even if a particular flow by itself doesn't demonstrate the full attack behavior.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute        | Value                  | Brute Force Relevance                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dest Port        | 22 (SSH)              | SSH is a common brute force target                             |
| Flow Pattern     | SYN packet            | First step in establishing a connection                        |
| Multiple Flows?  | Implicitly Yes        | Brute force detected by many such flows in a short period      |
| Label            | bruteForce            | Likely due to grouping or context, not just this single packet |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This single flow** (a SYN packet to SSH) by itself does *not* constitute a brute force attack. However, in the context of flow-based labeling, it was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:

- **It is part of a broader pattern**: Multiple connection attempts to SSH in a short time from the same source is a signature of brute force attacks.
- **Labeling is applied at the session/host-activity level**, not just to individual flows.

**In short:**  
> The flow was labeled ""bruteForce"" because it is part of a series of attempts to connect to SSH (port 22), characteristic of a brute force attack, even if this specific flow is only a single SYN packet. The labeling reflects the overall attack pattern rather than the content of this one flow alone.

---

**If you need to explain this to someone non-technical:**

> ""This network flow is part of a pattern where someone tried to repeatedly connect to the SSH service (used for remote login) on a computer. That kind of activity is typical when someone is trying to guess passwords by brute force. Even though this record only shows one connection attempt, the broader pattern was identified as a brute force attack.""


Explanation: 72

Let's analyze your network flow attributes:

### Flow Details:
- **Start time**: 2017-03-20 11:18:55.926
- **Duration**: 0.0 (very short, possibly a single packet)
- **Proto**: TCP
- **Src IP**: 192.168.220.16
- **Src port**: 59414
- **Dest IP**: 192.168.200.8
- **Dest port**: 22 (SSH)
- **Packets**: 1
- **Bytes**: 74
- **Flags**: ....S. (only SYN flag set)

### How was it classified as ""bruteForce""?

#### 1. **Destination port 22 (SSH)**
- Brute force attacks are very often directed at remote login services like SSH (port 22), as attackers attempt to guess passwords and gain access.

#### 2. **SYN flag only**
- The only TCP flag set is SYN, which is the very first step in establishing a TCP connection. This flow shows a single SYN packet, meaning it's an attempt to initiate a connection, but we don't see the rest of the handshake or any data transfer.

#### 3. **Single packet, single byte count**
- This suggests that it's an individual connection attempt. In isolation, a single SYN to port 22 is not enough to definitively call it brute force. However...

#### 4. **Brute force attack pattern**
- Brute force attacks are typically characterized by **many repeated connection attempts** (often with different credentials) to a login service (such as SSH). In many network flow datasets, **each connection attempt is logged as a separate flow**. So, if your classifier is seeing many similar flows (SYN packets to port 22 from the same or different source IPs), it may classify them as brute force attempts, even if each flow in isolation looks like a normal connection attempt.

#### 5. **Why not other labels?**
- **DoS**: Usually involves a high number of packets, often to a variety of ports or services, and often with repeated attempts to overwhelm the server, not just login attempts.
- **PortScan**: Involves SYNs to **many different ports** on the same target, not just port 22.
- **PingScan**: Uses ICMP, not TCP.
- **No attack (""---"")**: If the model/labeling system sees a pattern of SYNs to SSH, it may be tuned to err on the side of caution and label as brute force.

### **Summary Explanation**

> **This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a TCP SYN packet attempting to connect to port 22 (SSH), a common target for brute force attacks. In most detection systems, repeated SYN packets to SSH, especially from the same or similar sources, are indicative of brute force password guessing attempts. Even though this flow represents a single connection attempt, it likely fits the pattern (among many similar flows) that the classifier associates with brute force attacks.**

If you only see this *one* flow, it might be a misclassification; but in context (with many such flows), it is a typical brute force attack fingerprint.

---

**If you need a more detailed explanation or the logic behind the classifier, let me know!**


Explanation: 73

Let's break down the provided network flow attributes and analyze why it might have been classified as `""bruteForce""`:

---

### Flow Attributes

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-21 13:19:45.999  
- **Duration:** 0.004 seconds (4 milliseconds)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source Port:** 44706
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.4
- **Destination Port:** 22
- **Packets:** 5
- **Bytes:** 610
- **Flags:** `.AP..F` (ACK, PSH, FIN)

---

## What is a BruteForce Attack?

A **brute force attack** typically refers to repeated, rapid attempts to authenticate (usually with different passwords) to a service (often SSH on port 22). Such attacks are characterized by:

- A high number of short-lived connections to an authentication service (like SSH)
- Multiple login attempts within a short period
- Often, multiple small flows to the same port (e.g., port 22 for SSH)

---

## Analysis of This Flow

Let's look at what we have:

### 1. **Destination Port: 22**
Port 22 is the default port for SSH (Secure Shell), a service that is often targeted by brute force attacks because attackers try to guess user credentials.

### 2. **Short Duration & Small Number of Packets**
- The flow lasted only **0.004 seconds** (very short).
- Only **5 packets** and **610 bytes** were exchanged.
- This suggests a failed authentication attempt, as successful SSH logins usually generate longer sessions with more traffic.

### 3. **TCP Flags: `.AP..F`**
- `.AP..F` means the flow saw **ACK (A)**, **PSH (P)**, and **FIN (F)** flags.
    - **ACK**: Acknowledgment of packets
    - **PSH**: Push data to the receiving application
    - **FIN**: Finish, used to close a connection
- These flags are typical for short-lived application-layer sessions (e.g., a quick data send followed by immediate connection closure), consistent with failed login attempts.

### 4. **No Signs of DoS, Port Scan, or Ping Scan**
- **DoS** (Denial of Service): Usually characterized by large numbers of packets/bytes or attempts to overwhelm the target. This flow is small and short.
- **Port Scan**: Involves scanning many different ports, but this flow targets only port 22.
- **Ping Scan**: Uses ICMP, not TCP.

---

## **Why ""bruteForce""?**

**Given the context:**
- The flow targets SSH (port 22).
- The connection is very short and transmits minimal data (typical of failed login attempts).
- The TCP flags indicate a quick open-send-close pattern.
- The flow doesn't fit the pattern for other attack types.

**A brute force attack is often detected not by a single flow, but by a pattern of many such flows** (i.e., this flow is one of many short SSH attempts from the same or different source IPs). In network datasets for cyberattack detection, even a single flow with these characteristics to port 22 can be labeled as ""bruteforce"" if it fits the typical profile.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute           | Value             | BruteForce Justification                                               |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dest Port           | 22                | SSH service, common brute force target                                |
| Duration            | 0.004 s           | Very short, indicates likely failed login                             |
| Packets/Bytes       | 5 / 610           | Low, consistent with failed authentication attempts                   |
| TCP Flags           | .AP..F            | Quick data send and close, matches failed login behavior              |
| Other labels        | Not matching      | Doesn't fit DoS, port scan, or ping scan patterns                     |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It's a short, small TCP session to SSH (port 22),
- With flags and duration consistent with a failed login attempt,
- Which is a typical signature of brute force attack activity against SSH.

If you have further context (e.g. many such flows from the same source), this further strengthens the brute force classification.


Explanation: 74

Let’s analyze the **network flow** attributes and why it might have been labeled as **""bruteForce""**:

---

### **Flow Attributes Breakdown**

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:02:16.493  
- **Duration:** 0.159 seconds (very short)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.200.4
- **Source port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Destination port:** 36517 (ephemeral port, likely client side)
- **Packets:** 11
- **Bytes:** 2085
- **Flags:** .AP.S.

---

### **Key Observations**

1. **Source Port 22 (SSH):**
   - **Port 22** is the default port for **SSH** (Secure Shell), which is commonly attacked with brute force attempts (trying many password combinations).

2. **Short Duration, Multiple Packets:**
   - In **0.159 seconds**, the flow transferred **11 packets** and **2085 bytes**.
   - This is a burst of activity in a short time, which may be indicative of rapid connection attempts or authentication attempts.

3. **TCP Flags: `.AP.S.`**
   - **A**: ACK (Acknowledgement)
   - **P**: PSH (Push)
   - **S**: SYN (Synchronize)
   - The sequence of flags suggests a SYN to start a connection, followed by ACK and PSH, meaning data transfer occurred (potentially authentication attempts).

4. **Direction:**
   - Source IP is on port 22, suggesting this is the **SSH server** sending data to a client, maybe responding to connection or authentication attempts.

---

### **Why ""bruteForce""?**

- **Brute Force Attacks** on SSH typically involve:
  - A large number of rapid authentication attempts.
  - Short-lived connections.
  - Multiple packets in a short time frame.
- The **flow characteristics** here match this pattern:
  - **Service is SSH (port 22)**
  - **Short, rapid burst of traffic**
  - **Non-standard destination port** (likely automated tool on attacker side)
  - **Multiple packets (11) in 0.159s** suggests repeated attempts or negotiation

---

### **Why Not the Other Labels?**

- **""---"" (Normal):**  
  Normal SSH traffic often has longer sessions and less bursty connection patterns.
- **""dos"":**  
  Denial of Service usually involves flooding or resource exhaustion, often with more volume or targeting service availability.
- **""portScan"":**  
  Would involve many different destination ports, not just 22.
- **""pingScan"":**  
  Would involve ICMP, not TCP/SSH.

---

## **Summary**

This flow is labeled as **""bruteForce""** because:
- It involves traffic to/from **SSH (port 22)**
- The flow is **short-lived**, with **multiple packets** in a **burst**, consistent with repeated authentication attempts.
- **Flags** and **traffic pattern** match what’s expected from brute force attacks (rapid, automated attempts to gain access via SSH).

**Conclusion:**  
The combination of **service (SSH)**, **short duration with multiple packets**, and **traffic pattern** is highly indicative of a brute force attack, which is why this flow is classified as **""bruteForce""**.


Explanation: 75

Let's break down the network flow you provided:

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:22:43.982  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source port:** 34199  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8  
- **Destination port:** 22 (SSH)  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 74  
- **TCP Flags:** ....S. (SYN flag only)  

**Label assigned:** ""bruteForce""

---

## 1. **What does the flow represent?**

This flow is a **single TCP SYN packet** from `192.168.220.16:34199` to `192.168.200.8:22` (SSH port).  
- **SYN flag:** This is the start of a new TCP connection attempt.
- **Duration 0.0, 1 packet, 74 bytes:** Only one packet seen, and the connection did not proceed beyond this initial SYN.

---

## 2. **Why not the other labels?**
Let's quickly eliminate the other labels:

- **""---"" (Normal flow):**  
  - A normal flow usually has the three-way TCP handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and possibly data transfer, not just a single SYN.

- **""dos"" (Denial of Service):**  
  - Single SYN packets are not a DoS by themselves. DoS involves a flood or sustained attack.

- **""portScan"":**  
  - Port scan is usually characterized by a source IP probing **many different ports** on a target, or one port on **many hosts**. This flow shows a single SYN to a single port.

- **""pingScan"":**  
  - Involves ICMP (ping), but this is a TCP flow.

---

## 3. **Why ""bruteForce""?**

- **Brute force attacks on SSH:**  
  - Typically, brute force on SSH involves **repeated attempts to connect** (and login) to port 22.
  - Each attempt starts with a TCP SYN packet to port 22.
  - In datasets, **each SYN packet to port 22 may be labeled as a brute force attempt**, especially if the system is under attack and many such flows occur in succession.

- **Dataset labeling practice:**  
  - Many network security datasets label **all connection attempts to SSH during an ongoing brute force attack** as ""bruteForce"", even if it's just the SYN packet.
  - Usually, such a label would make sense **only if this flow is part of a larger pattern**—for example, this single SYN packet is one of many (from this or other sources) trying to connect to SSH in a short period (e.g., hundreds or thousands of SYNs to port 22).

---

## 4. **Summary**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It is a TCP SYN packet **targeting the SSH service (port 22)**.
- In the context of the labeled dataset, **all SYN packets to port 22 during a brute force attack window are labeled as ""bruteForce""**, even if the flow itself is just a single connection attempt.
- The actual attack is characterized by **many such flows in quick succession**, but each individual attempt is labeled as part of the brute force attack.

---

### **Caveat**

**With only this one flow, it is not possible to definitively say that it is brute force without context.** However, the dataset's labeling policy likely marks all SYNs to SSH as ""bruteForce"" during attack periods.

---

## **Concise Explanation**

> **This flow was labeled ""bruteForce"" because it is a TCP SYN packet attempting to connect to the SSH service (port 22). In the dataset, all such connection attempts to SSH during a brute force attack (typically characterized by repeated connection attempts) are labeled as ""bruteForce"", even if the flow is only a single SYN packet.**


Explanation: 76

Let's analyze the **network flow attributes** and the possible **attack labels**:

### **Network Flow Details**
- **Start Time:** 2017-03-20 10:02:21.232  
- **Duration:** 1.308 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.200.4  
- **Src Port:** 22 (**SSH**)  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Dest Port:** 36519  
- **Packets:** 16  
- **Bytes:** 2547  
- **TCP Flags:** .AP.SF

### **Possible Labels**
- ""---"": Normal flow
- ""dos"": Denial of Service
- ""portScan"": Port scan
- ""bruteForce"": Brute Force attack
- ""pingScan"": Ping scan

---

## **Why was this flow classified as ""bruteForce""?**

### **Key Points from the Flow:**

1. **Source Port 22 (SSH):**  
   - The source port is **22**, which is the standard port for SSH. This suggests the flow originated from the SSH server (or a client using an ephemeral port 22, but that's rare).

2. **Destination Port is High (36519):**  
   - This is a high, likely ephemeral port on the destination. This suggests a connection initiated **from** the server **to** a client, which is unusual for SSH, unless responding to a client request.

3. **Packets and Duration:**  
   - 16 packets over 1.3 seconds, with 2547 bytes exchanged, is typical for a short-lived SSH session or repeated connection attempts.

4. **TCP Flags (.AP.SF):**  
   - The concatenated TCP flags seen:  
     - **A**: ACK  
     - **P**: PSH  
     - **S**: SYN  
     - **F**: FIN  
   - The sequence **SYN**, **ACK**, **PSH**, **FIN** indicates a connection was initiated, data was sent, and the session was closed.  
   - However, the presence of these flags together suggests several short-lived connections or quick session attempts, which can be a signature of brute force attacks.

### **Typical Brute Force Attack Pattern:**
- **SSH Brute Force:** Attackers try to guess SSH credentials by repeatedly attempting logins.
- **Network Indicators:**
  - Multiple short-lived SSH connections.
  - Sessions often terminated quickly after failed login attempts.
  - Multiple packets, but not a large data transfer, as the connection is dropped after authentication fails.

### **Why Not Other Labels?**
- **DoS:** Usually much higher packet/byte volume and longer/continuous flows.
- **PortScan/PingScan:** Would involve many ports or ICMP, not repeated access to port 22.
- **Normal:** This pattern is not typical for legitimate SSH use, especially if repeated many times.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute   | Value       | Brute Force Indicator? |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Src Port    | 22 (SSH)    | Yes                   |
| Packets     | 16/1.3s     | Yes (short bursts)    |
| TCP Flags   | .AP.SF      | Yes (SYN, FIN, etc.)  |
| Bytes       | 2547        | Modest, fits pattern  |
| Duration    | 1.3s        | Short-lived           |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It involves SSH (port 22).
- It is a short-lived connection with a typical pattern of connection initiation (SYN), data transfer (PSH), acknowledgement (ACK), and session closure (FIN).
- The number of packets and bytes suggest repeated, automated attempts rather than a normal user session.
- These are classic signs of a brute force attack, where an attacker rapidly tries multiple SSH logins, resulting in multiple short-lived connections.

**If this pattern is repeated across multiple flows from the same source, it would strongly confirm brute force activity.**


Explanation: 77

Let's break down the **attributes** of the flow and see if they justify the classification as **""bruteForce""**:

---

### 1. **Flow Attributes**

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 11:32:05.472
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Src port:** 42305
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Dest port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 74
- **Flags:** ....S. (only SYN flag is set)

---

### 2. **What is a Brute Force Attack?**

A brute force attack generally involves repeatedly attempting to gain access to a service by systematically trying different credentials, typically on services like SSH (port 22).

---

### 3. **Analysis of the Flow**

- **Destination Port 22:** This is the default port for SSH, which is a common target for brute force login attempts.
- **SYN Flag Only:** The flow has a single TCP SYN packet (flags = ....S.), which indicates the initiation of a TCP connection. There is no ACK, RST, or FIN, which means the connection did not progress beyond the initial handshake attempt.
- **Single Packet, Single Byte Count:** Only one packet (74 bytes) was seen, again consistent with a single connection attempt.

---

### 4. **Does this fit a brute force attack?**

**Not by itself.**  
A single SYN packet to port 22 is merely a connection attempt to the SSH service. For brute force classification, you would typically expect:

- **Multiple connection attempts** (from the same IP or across IPs) to port 22,
- Or **multiple failed logins** within a short time window.

**A single SYN packet** could be part of:
- A normal SSH connection attempt (if there were a successful handshake and authentication),
- The start of a brute force campaign (if this is one of many similar flows),
- A port scan (if similar SYNs are sent to many ports/hosts),
- Or simply benign activity.

---

### 5. **Why might it be labeled ""bruteForce""?**

- **Contextual Mislabeling:** If you only have this single flow, the label ""bruteForce"" is likely based on context not provided here (e.g., this is one of many flows from this source to port 22 on this or other hosts).
- **Automated Labeling:** Sometimes, intrusion detection systems label **all connection attempts to port 22 as ""bruteForce""** when they're part of a larger pattern.
- **Dataset Label Propagation:** In some datasets, a group of flows from the same source in a short window are labeled as ""bruteForce"" if, taken together, they represent brute forcing.

---

### 6. **Summary Table**

| Flow Attribute        | Value                | Relevance to Brute Force                  |
|---------------------- |---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Dest Port             | 22                  | SSH, common brute force target            |
| Flags                 | SYN only            | Initial connection attempt                |
| Packets               | 1                   | Only one attempt visible                  |
| Duration              | 0.0                 | No session established                    |

---

### **Conclusion**

**Based solely on this single flow**, there is not enough information to definitively justify a ""bruteForce"" label. This flow **might** be part of a larger set of flows (not shown here) which, together, represent brute force activity (i.e., many SYNs to port 22 from the same source). 

**If this is the only flow**, then the classification as ""bruteForce"" is likely either due to automated or heuristic labeling based on destination port 22 being a typical target for brute force attacks, or due to its membership in a group of flows that, together, constitute brute forcing.

**In summary:**  
The flow is labeled ""bruteForce"" likely because it is a TCP SYN to SSH (port 22), which is a typical pattern for brute force attacks, especially if there are many such attempts from the same source IP in a short period. The label assumes this is part of a brute force campaign, not a benign single connection.


Explanation: 78

Sure! Let's break down the attributes of your network flow and explain why it may have been classified as **""bruteForce""**:

### 1. **Source and Destination**
- **Src IP:** `192.168.200.4`
- **Src port:** `22` (SSH)
- **Dest IP:** `192.168.220.16`
- **Dest port:** `45042.0` (ephemeral port on client)

**Port 22** is the default port for SSH, which is a common target for brute-force attacks.

---

### 2. **Duration and Packet Count**
- **Duration:** `1.45` seconds
- **Packets:** `16`
- **Bytes:** `2547`

A short but active connection with multiple packets and non-trivial data volume suggests some exchange is happening, potentially multiple login attempts.

---

### 3. **Flags**
- `.AP.SF`

Let's break down the flags:
- **A**: ACK (Acknowledgement)
- **P**: PSH (Push data)
- **S**: SYN (Start of connection)
- **F**: FIN (Finish connection)
- The `.` means the flag is not set.

The presence of `S` (SYN), `A` (ACK), `P` (PSH), and `F` (FIN) means:
- The flow included connection establishment (`SYN`), data transfer (`PSH`), and connection teardown (`FIN`).
- This is consistent with an application protocol session such as SSH.

---

### 4. **Why Not Other Labels?**
- **""dos""**: Typically involves a much higher number of packets/bytes in a short time, often with SYN floods or repeated requests to exhaust resources.
- **""portScan""**: Would show the source IP probing multiple destination ports.
- **""pingScan""**: Would involve ICMP protocol, not TCP.
- **""---"" (normal)**: Brute-force attempts can look like normal connections, but certain patterns (like repeated, rapid login attempts over SSH) raise suspicion.

---

### 5. **Why ""bruteForce""?**
- **SSH is a common brute-force target.**
- **Multiple packets in a short duration**: 16 packets in 1.45 seconds, which is enough time for several failed login attempts before the connection is closed.
- **Flags indicate a full session**: SYN (start), data (PSH), FIN (finish)—consistent with attempts to log in and then disconnect.
- **Source port is 22 (server side)**: This suggests the flow is from the server to the client, possibly indicating the server responding to repeated login attempts.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute   | Value              | BruteForce indicator?                  |
|-------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Proto       | TCP                | Yes, SSH is over TCP                   |
| Src port    | 22 (SSH)           | Yes, common brute-force target         |
| Duration    | 1.45 s             | Short, typical for rapid login attempts|
| Packets     | 16                 | Moderate, could be multiple attempts   |
| Flags       | .AP.SF             | Full session (establish, transfer, end)|
|             |                    |                                        |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It involves the SSH port (22), a common brute-force target.
- The connection has characteristics (short duration, moderate packets, full session flags) compatible with rapid, repeated SSH login attempts.
- It does not match the patterns of port/ping scans or denial of service.

**If you have multiple such flows from the same source, it would further strengthen the brute-force classification.**


Explanation: 79

Let's break down the flow attributes and analyze why it might be classified as **""bruteForce""**.

### Flow Attributes:

- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-21 13:21:29.570  
- **Duration:** 0.162 seconds (very short-lived)
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.200.4  
- **Src port:** 22 (SSH)  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Dest port:** 44758  
- **Packets:** 11  
- **Bytes:** 2085  
- **Flags:** .AP.S.

---

### Analysis

#### 1. **Destination Port & Protocol**
- **Source port 22**: This is the standard port for **SSH** (Secure Shell), which is commonly targeted in brute-force attacks.
- **TCP protocol**: SSH uses TCP.

#### 2. **Flow Direction**
- The flow is **originating from port 22** (i.e., from the SSH server to a high-numbered destination port on a client). This suggests it's a server replying to a client connection.

#### 3. **Duration & Number of Packets**
- **Short duration (0.162s)**: Indicates a quick connection, possibly terminated due to failed authentication or rapid succession of connection attempts.
- **11 packets and 2085 bytes**: Not a huge amount, but enough for several protocol exchanges (e.g., SSH handshake and a few authentication attempts).

#### 4. **TCP Flags**
- **Flags: .AP.S.**
  - **A** (ACK): Acknowledgement.
  - **P** (PSH): Push data (sending data to the application layer).
  - **S** (SYN): Synchronize sequence numbers (initiate a connection).
- The sequence **.AP.S.** suggests the connection was established (SYN), acknowledged (ACK), and actual data was pushed (PSH). This is typical in TCP connections where data transmission occurs (like SSH login attempts).

#### 5. **Brute Force Attack Behavior**
- **Brute-force attacks** on SSH typically involve:
  - Multiple short-lived connections from a single source to an SSH server.
  - Repeated attempts to guess the username/password.
  - Each attempt may result in a short flow (failed login, connection terminated quickly).
  - Often, many such flows are observed within a short time frame.

---

### **Why ""bruteForce""?**

- **Target Service:** The flow is related to SSH (port 22), a common brute-force target.
- **Short-lived bursty connection:** Brute-force attacks generate many short, failed SSH connections.
- **Packet/byte count:** Enough for handshake and a few authentication exchanges (consistent with rapid login attempts).
- **Flags:** Show a completed TCP handshake and data push, indicating authentication attempts occurred.
- **Likely context (not shown):** If this flow is one of many similar flows (from the same/different source IPs to port 22), it strongly indicates brute-force activity.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute      | Value                | Brute-force Relevance                        |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Src port       | 22 (SSH)            | SSH is a common brute-force target           |
| Duration       | 0.162s               | Short, typical for failed login attempts     |
| Packets/Bytes  | 11 / 2085           | Enough for a login attempt                   |
| Flags          | .AP.S.              | Indicates handshake + data (login attempt)   |
| Pattern        | (Implied) Many similar flows | Characteristic of brute-force attacks |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It involves SSH (port 22), which is frequently targeted for brute-force logins.
- The connection is short-lived, with just enough data exchanged for a login attempt.
- The TCP flags and packet/byte count suggest a completed handshake and authentication attempt.
- If this is one of many such flows, it matches typical brute-force behavior.

**If you have access to more flows from the same source/destination, you would likely see a pattern of many such short SSH connections, confirming the brute-force activity.**


Explanation: 80

Let's break down the flow attributes and the **classification**:

### Flow Attributes

- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-20 10:49:12.384  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Proto:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Src port:** 40321
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Dest port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 74
- **Flags:** ....S. (SYN flag set)

### What does this flow represent?
This is a **single TCP SYN packet** from 192.168.220.16:40321 to 192.168.200.8:22 (SSH).  
- **Duration is 0.0** (single packet, no handshake completed)
- **Only SYN flag**: This means only the initial connection attempt was made. No response or further packets.

### Why might this be classified as **""bruteForce""**?

#### 1. **Typical Brute Force Attack Pattern**
Brute force SSH attacks typically involve **repeated connection attempts** to SSH (port 22) to try different usernames/passwords.  
**However, a single SYN packet by itself is not enough** to definitively identify brute force activity. Usually, you'd expect to see multiple connection attempts, with completed three-way handshakes and perhaps failed login attempts.

#### 2. **Misclassification Possibility**
A **single SYN packet to port 22** is more likely to be:
- A normal connection attempt (if it completes handshake)
- Part of a port scan (if many SYNs to different ports/hosts)
- Part of a brute force, **only if** it's one of many SYNs specifically to SSH.

#### 3. **Why not ""portScan""?**
If there were many SYN packets to multiple ports or hosts, it would more likely be a port scan. If there are many SYN packets to **just port 22**, that could be the start of a brute force attack.

#### 4. **Why not ""normal"" flow (""---"")?**
If the classifier saw **many similar flows** from this source to port 22, it could have decided it's brute force.  
But for a **single flow**, this is a weak indicator.

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute              | BruteForce       | PortScan         | Normal          |
|------------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Port                   | 22 (SSH)         | Many/varied      | Any             |
| Flags                  | SYN (initial)    | SYN to many      | SYN/ACK/PSH     |
| Packet count           | Often high       | High             | Low/normal      |
| Duration               | Often low        | Very low         | Varies          |
| Repetition             | Yes, repeated    | Yes, many ports  | No              |

### **Conclusion**

**The likely reason for this classification:**
- Because the **destination port is 22 (SSH)**, and if the **classifier was trained** so that **any SYN to port 22 from an unknown external host is scored as brute force**, it would label it as such—**even though this is not always correct**.

**In reality:**  
- **A single SYN to SSH is not sufficient evidence of a brute force attack.**
- **Brute force attacks** are typically identified by many repeated connection attempts to SSH over a short interval.

**So, the classification is likely based on:**
- **Destination port 22**
- **SYN flag (connection attempt)**
- **Possibly prior knowledge (e.g., source not whitelisted, or part of a repeated pattern in your dataset)**

**If this flow is isolated, it's likely a false positive.**  
If it's one of **many similar flows** from the same source, then it's a reasonable brute force indicator.

---

**In summary:**  
*The flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a TCP SYN packet attempting to connect to port 22 (SSH), which is a common target for brute force attacks. The classifier likely flagged it based on the port and connection attempt pattern, possibly in combination with other flows or prior knowledge.*


Explanation: 81

Let's break down the flow attributes and analyze why it could be classified as **""bruteForce""**:

---

### Flow Attributes Review

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-21 13:19:53.986  
- **Duration:** 1.465 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.200.4  
- **Source Port:** 22  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Destination Port:** 44711  
- **Packets:** 16  
- **Bytes:** 2547  
- **TCP Flags:** `.AP.SF`

---

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. **Port 22 (SSH) as Source Port**
- Port 22 is the default port for **SSH (Secure Shell)**.
- A flow **originating from port 22** is unusual unless this is a response from an SSH server (i.e., the server is sending data back to a client).
- However, in many netflow systems, the ""Src port"" is the port on the **originating machine**, which, if 22, means this is likely **SSH traffic**.

#### 2. **Destination Port: 44711**
- This is a **high, ephemeral port**, typical of client-side ports.
- Suggests the **client** is at `192.168.220.16`, initiating a connection to the **server** at `192.168.200.4` (on port 22).

#### 3. **Number of Packets and Duration**
- **16 packets** over **1.465 seconds** is consistent with a short interactive session, or possibly multiple rapid attempts.

#### 4. **TCP Flags: `.AP.SF`**
- **A**: ACK (acknowledgement)
- **P**: PSH (push)
- **S**: SYN (synchronize)
- **F**: FIN (finish)
- The flag sequence suggests a typical connection setup, data transfer, and connection teardown.

#### 5. **Brute Force Characteristics**
- **Brute force attacks** on SSH usually involve:
  - Multiple rapid connection attempts from one host to an SSH server (port 22).
  - Each attempt may be short-lived (quick connect, try password, disconnect).
  - Each flow may show only a few packets, as failed authentication closes the session quickly.
  - The source IP stays the same, and the destination port is always 22.

---

### **Why ""bruteForce""?**

- **The flow shows a short-lived SSH connection (port 22) from a client.**
- **16 packets and 2.5KB data** is more than a single TCP handshake but much less than a normal, interactive SSH session.
- **Multiple similar flows** (not shown here, but likely in dataset) from the same host in a short time window are classic evidence of brute force attacks, as the attacker tries many username/password combinations.
- **The presence of SYN, PSH, FIN, ACK** flags suggests the connection was established, some data sent, then closed—typical of an authentication attempt.
- **Not a DoS:** There’s no sign of overwhelming traffic or huge packet volume.
- **Not a Port Scan:** Destination port is fixed (22), not scanning multiple ports.
- **Not a Ping Scan:** Protocol is TCP, not ICMP.
- **Not Normal:** The pattern matches attack behavior, not a typical SSH session.

---

**In summary:**  
This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it matches the pattern of an SSH brute force attack: a short-lived SSH connection to port 22 with traffic consistent with an authentication attempt, likely part of a rapid sequence of similar flows targeting the SSH service.

**If you had access to the rest of the flows from this period, you would likely see many such flows, all to port 22, from the same source to the same destination, further confirming brute force activity.**


Explanation: 82

Let's analyze the flow details and classification:

**Flow Details:**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 11:34:18.689
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Src port:** 44326
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Dest port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 74
- **Flags:** ....S. (SYN only)

**Classification:**  
Labeled as **""bruteForce""**.

---

### Let's break it down:

#### 1. **Connection to Port 22**
- **Port 22** is the standard port for SSH (Secure Shell), a common target for brute force attacks.
- **Brute force attacks** against SSH typically involve repeatedly attempting to log in by trying many username/password combinations.

#### 2. **Flow Characteristics**
- This flow **only contains a single TCP SYN packet** (`....S.`), indicating an attempt to initiate a connection but no further communication (no ACK, no data exchange).
- **Single packet, short duration:** This resembles just the opening handshake attempt, not a full login.

#### 3. **Why Not ""portScan""?**
- **Port scan** would typically involve SYN packets to *many different ports* or hosts to detect which services are open.
- Here, the destination is a *single port* (22) on a single host, which is more indicative of a targeted action rather than a scan.

#### 4. **Why Not ""dos"", ""pingScan"", or ""---""?**
- **DoS attack:** Would show many packets, often with abnormal patterns, and usually target service disruption.
- **Ping scan:** Involves ICMP, not TCP. This is a TCP flow.
- **No attack (""---""):** While a single SYN to port 22 could be benign, the context (repeated SYNs from the same source to SSH) is often flagged as brute force, especially if part of a pattern.

---

### **So why ""bruteForce""?**
- The classifier likely labeled this as ""bruteForce"" because:
  - **Target is port 22 (SSH)**, which is a common brute force target.
  - **SYN packet:** Indicating an attempt to initiate an SSH connection, which, if observed repeatedly, matches brute force behavior.
  - **Source port random/high (44326):** Typical of automated attack tools.
  - **If this flow is part of a sequence (not shown here),** with many such SYNs from the same source to the same destination/port, it's highly indicative of brute force attempts.

### **Possible Reason for Misclassification**
- If this is an *isolated* flow (just one SYN, no repeated attempts), it could be a false positive.
- Many classifiers, especially with limited flow context, err on the side of caution and label *any* SYN to SSH as ""bruteForce"" if seen as part of an attack pattern.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute           | Value                | BruteForce Indicator?        |
|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| Dest Port           | 22 (SSH)            | Yes, common brute force target |
| TCP Flags           | SYN                 | Yes, new connection attempt    |
| Packets             | 1                   | Ambiguous (could be part of attack) |
| Duration            | 0.0                 | New or failed connection      |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was labeled ""bruteForce"" because it is a TCP SYN packet targeting port 22 (SSH), which is a common pattern in SSH brute force attacks.** Even though it's just one packet, the labeling system may classify any SYN to SSH as ""bruteForce""—especially if this is one of many such flows from the same source IP.

**If you have more context (such as repeated similar flows), the brute force classification makes even more sense. Otherwise, the classifier is being cautious due to the target port.**


Explanation: 83

Let's analyze the network flow attributes and the classification:

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-20 10:03:38.366  
- **Duration:** 0.159 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source Port:** 37240  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.4  
- **Dest Port:** 22.0  
- **Packets:** 11  
- **Bytes:** 3049  
- **TCP Flags:** .AP.S.

### Label: ""bruteForce""

#### Why it might be classified as ""bruteForce"":

**1. Destination Port 22 (SSH):**
- Port 22 is the default port for SSH. Brute force attacks commonly target SSH to gain unauthorized access by trying many username/password combinations.

**2. High Number of Packets/Bytes in Short Time:**
- 11 packets and 3049 bytes in just 0.159 seconds suggest rapid, repeated attempts.
- This pattern is consistent with brute force attacks, where automated tools send multiple authentication attempts in quick succession.

**3. TCP Flags:**
- The flags are **.AP.S.** which means:
  - **A** (ACK): Acknowledgment field is significant.
  - **P** (PSH): Push function.
  - **S** (SYN): Synchronize sequence numbers.
- The presence of **SYN** suggests initiation of new connections.
- The combination **AP** (ACK+PSH) is typical during data transfer, such as sending login credentials.
- Multiple **SYN**s in a short period, especially to port 22, often indicates repeated login attempts.

**4. Source and Destination IPs:**
- Internal source and destination IPs, but that's less relevant than the protocol and port.

### Why not the other attack types?

- **dos:** Would show much higher packet counts, often with the goal of overwhelming the service, not specifically targeting port 22 with this pattern.
- **portScan:** Would involve many destination ports, not just port 22.
- **pingScan:** Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **--- (normal):** Normal flows to port 22 would generally have fewer packets in a short time, unless actively transferring files or commands, but even so, this rapid burst to port 22 is unusual.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute        | Value           | Why it suggests bruteForce?               |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Dest Port        | 22             | SSH, common target for brute force        |
| Packets/Bytes    | 11 / 3049      | High for 0.159s, suggests rapid attempts  |
| Duration         | 0.159 seconds  | Many packets/bytes in very short time     |
| TCP Flags        | .AP.S.         | Multiple connection attempts/data push    |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it represents multiple, rapid connection attempts to an SSH server (port 22) in a very short time, matching the typical signature of an SSH brute force attack.** The combination of a high number of packets, the destination port, and the TCP flags all point toward repeated, automated login attempts, which is the hallmark of brute force activity.


Explanation: 84

Let's analyze your network flow and the possible reasoning behind the classification as **""bruteForce""**.

### Flow Attributes

| Attribute     | Value                     |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Start time    | 2017-03-21 13:21:45.497  |
| Duration      | 0.131 seconds            |
| Proto         | TCP                      |
| Src IP        | 192.168.220.16           |
| Src port      | 44766                    |
| Dest IP       | 192.168.200.4            |
| Dest port     | 22.0 (SSH)               |
| Packets       | 13                       |
| Bytes         | 3181                     |
| Flags         | .AP.S.                   |

### Key Details

1. **Destination Port: 22**
    - This is the standard port for SSH (Secure Shell), a common target for brute-force login attempts.
2. **Duration: 0.131 seconds**
    - The flow is very short-lived, which is typical for automated attack tools rapidly attempting connections/logins.
3. **Packets: 13 / Bytes: 3181**
    - A relatively high number of packets and bytes for such a short duration, suggesting rapid data exchange, possibly multiple login attempts.
4. **TCP Flags: .AP.S.**
    - **A**CK, **P**SH, **S**YN flags are set.
        - **SYN**: Indicates start of a TCP connection.
        - **ACK**: Acknowledgement.
        - **PSH**: Data is being pushed.
    - The presence of SYN suggests connection attempts; PSH/ACK suggest data (like login credentials) is being sent immediately after connection establishment.

### Reasoning for ""bruteForce"" Classification

#### 1. **Target Service (SSH)**
   - Brute force attacks often target login services like SSH on port 22.

#### 2. **Connection Behavior**
   - Short duration, but multiple packets and reasonable data volume, suggest a script or tool is rapidly sending login attempts and immediately closing or resetting connections.

#### 3. **TCP Flags Pattern**
   - The sequence **.AP.S.** shows that after establishing a connection (SYN), the attacker quickly sends data (likely credentials), pushing data to the server (PSH), and acknowledges packets (ACK). This is common for brute-force tools trying many passwords in rapid succession.

#### 4. **Not PortScan, DoS, or PingScan**
   - **PortScan**: Would target multiple ports, not just port 22.
   - **DoS**: Would involve huge numbers of packets/bytes or many flows, not a single flow with this pattern.
   - **PingScan**: Uses ICMP, not TCP.

#### 5. **Not a Normal Flow**
   - Normal SSH usage would have longer durations, more even packet exchanges, and not such rapid, repeated connection attempts.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Label         | Why not?                                                                  |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ""---""         | Not normal: short, bursty, with login-pattern flags on SSH                |
| dos           | Not enough packets/bytes, no flooding pattern                             |
| portScan      | Only port 22 targeted, not multiple ports                                 |
| pingScan      | Not ICMP, this is TCP                                                    |
| bruteForce    | **Rapid, repeated, short-lived SSH login attempts with data, classic brute force pattern** |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because it matches the typical behavior of a brute-force attack against SSH:**
- Short, rapid connections to port 22/TCP,
- Multiple packets and data transferred quickly (likely multiple password attempts),
- TCP flags indicating quick connection and data transfer,
- Not targeting multiple ports or using ICMP.

**This is classic brute-force attack behavior against SSH.**


Explanation: 85

Let's break down the **network flow** details and analyze **why it might have been classified as ""bruteForce""**:

---

### Flow Summary

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 11:01:12.170
- **Duration:** 0.0
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source port:** 53240
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Destination port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 74
- **Flags:** ....S. (SYN)

---

### Key Observations

1. **Destination Port 22 (SSH):**
   - SSH is a common target for brute-force attacks where attackers attempt to guess login credentials.

2. **Single SYN Packet:**
   - The only packet in this flow is a TCP SYN, which is used to initiate a connection.
   - No data is exchanged yet (no ACK, no payload).

3. **No Duration:**
   - Duration is 0.0, which means the flow was extremely short—likely a single connection attempt.

4. **Single Packet, Small Size:**
   - Only 1 packet, 74 bytes (typical size for a SYN packet).

---

### About **BruteForce** Attacks

A brute-force SSH attack typically involves:
- Repeatedly trying to connect to port 22 on a host.
- Attempting different username/password combinations.
- Usually, it results in **many short-lived connections**, each starting with a SYN packet.

However, **from this flow alone**, we only see **one connection attempt**.

---

### Why Was It Classified as ""bruteForce""?

#### Possible Reasoning

- **Contextual Classification:**
  - If this flow is part of a **sequence** of similar flows (multiple SYNs from the same source to port 22), the system might classify each as part of a brute-force attack.
  - Machine learning classifiers often use **per-flow features** but are trained with the knowledge of attack patterns (e.g., many SYNs to port 22 from the same IP in a short period).

- **Feature-Based Labeling:**
  - Dest port is 22 (SSH). This is a high-risk service for brute-force attacks.
  - The flow is a single SYN, which is **how every brute-force attempt starts**.
  - Some datasets label **all flows in an attack window** as ""bruteForce"", even if the individual flow is just a SYN.

#### Why Not Other Labels?

- **Not ""dos"":** A DoS attack would typically involve high volume, many packets/bytes, or to a service like HTTP/ICMP. This is just a single SYN.
- **Not ""portScan"":** Port scans usually target many ports, not just port 22.
- **Not ""pingScan"":** This is TCP, not ICMP.
- **Not ""---"" (Normal):** Port 22 is frequently attacked, and a SYN from a non-local address may be suspicious.
- **Not ""portScan"":** Only one port targeted.

---

## **Summary Explanation**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**

- It is a TCP SYN packet targeting port 22 (SSH), which is the standard port for SSH brute-force attacks.
- **Brute-force attacks are characterized by many connection attempts to SSH (port 22), often seen as a sequence of SYN packets from the same source.**
- Even though this single flow isn't enough to confirm an attack, in many datasets and detection systems, every flow that is part of a brute-force campaign is individually labeled as ""bruteForce"".
- The labeling likely comes from context: this flow is part of a known brute-force attack sequence.

---

**In short:**  
*This flow is labeled ""bruteForce"" because it matches the typical pattern of brute-force SSH attacks—many SYN packets to port 22, even if each flow is just a single connection attempt. The classifier used context or prior knowledge of attack patterns in labeling this flow.*

---

**If you have more flows from this source to port 22 in the same time window, this would further confirm the brute-force pattern.**


Explanation: 86

Let's break down the network flow information you provided:

### Flow Attributes

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:47:07.198
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source port:** 39195
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Destination port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 74
- **Flags:** ....S. (only the SYN flag is set)

### Label: ""bruteForce""

#### What is a Brute Force Attack?
A brute force attack (in the context of network flows) typically refers to repeated attempts to guess credentials on a service like SSH (port 22), usually by sending many authentication requests in a short period of time.

---

## Why might this flow be classified as ""bruteForce""?

### 1. **Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
Port 22 is the standard port for SSH, a common target for brute force attacks, since attackers often try to gain unauthorized access by guessing usernames and passwords.

### 2. **SYN Packet**
- The only flag set is SYN (`....S.`), which means this is the start of a TCP connection attempt.
- Duration is 0.0, suggesting only the initial connection attempt, not a full connection or data transfer.

### 3. **Single Packet, Short Flow**
- Only 1 packet, 74 bytes: This is a single SYN packet trying to initiate a connection.
- Short (0.0s) duration: Suggests no actual session was established.

---

### **Why is this ""bruteForce"" and not ""portScan""?**

- **Port Scan**: Would involve attempts to connect to a *range* of ports (multiple destination ports) or IPs, looking for open ones. If this flow was part of many SYNs to many different ports, it would look like a scan.
- **Brute Force**: Typically, repeated attempts to a *single service* (in this case, SSH on port 22), possibly from the same or different source ports/IPs, often with many flows like this in a short time.

---

### **Contextual Clues**
- If your dataset or IDS (Intrusion Detection System) sees **many similar flows** from the same source to the same destination on port 22, it likely infers a brute force attempt.
- A single SYN to port 22 may not be brute force on its own, but if this is one of many similar flows, that's the logic.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | Value             | BruteForce Relevance          |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Dest Port         | 22 (SSH)          | Common brute force target     |
| Flag              | SYN only          | Connection attempt            |
| Duration          | 0.0               | No session established        |
| Packets           | 1                 | Single connection attempt     |
| Pattern           | (Likely repeated) | Repeated attempts = brute force |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a TCP SYN packet attempting to connect to the SSH port (22) on a remote host.** Brute force attacks typically involve many such connection attempts to the SSH service, trying to guess credentials. If this flow is one of many similar flows in your data, the classifier labels it as brute force based on this pattern.

---

**If you need to explain this to someone else, you can say:**

> ""The flow was labeled as 'bruteForce' because it is a SYN attempt to the SSH service (port 22), which is a common target for brute force attacks. Such attacks are characterized by repeated connection attempts to SSH, often visible as many short, single-packet flows like this one in the network logs.""

**If you'd like more details or have additional flows to analyze, let me know!**


Explanation: 87

Let's break down the key attributes of your network flow:

- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 50701  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.100.4  
- **Dest port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Packets:** 5  
- **Bytes:** 610  
- **Flags:** .AP..F (ACK, PSH, FIN)
- **Duration:** 0.028 seconds

### Why was this flow classified as ""bruteForce""?

**Brute force attacks** typically target services with authentication (like SSH, which is port 22) by rapidly attempting to log in using many different password/username combinations. Here’s why your flow fits this classification:

#### 1. **Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
- SSH is a common target for brute force attacks since it is used for remote logins.

#### 2. **TCP Protocol**
- Brute force attacks use TCP for authentication protocols like SSH.

#### 3. **Short Duration, Multiple Packets**
- The flow is only 0.028 seconds long, but it transmits 5 packets. Brute force attempts often consist of many short-lived, rapid connections, each trying a new password.

#### 4. **Number of Bytes**
- 610 bytes transferred in such a short time suggests the exchange of authentication data (not just a single SYN packet or a simple port probe).

#### 5. **TCP Flags: .AP..F**
- The flags indicate that data was pushed (**PSH**), acknowledged (**ACK**), and then the connection was gracefully closed (**FIN**). This matches the pattern of a client trying to log in (sending data), receiving a response, then closing the connection.

#### 6. **Not a Port Scan or Ping Scan**
- **Port scans** would try many different destination ports, often using SYN packets only; here, only port 22 is used.
- **Ping scans** would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **DoS attacks** would involve many packets/bytes or longer durations/large numbers of connections aimed at overwhelming the service.

#### 7. **Not Normal Traffic**
- Normal SSH usage typically involves longer sessions and more data after successful login, not such short, repetitive attempts.

---

## **Summary**

This flow was classified as **""bruteForce""** because:
- It targets SSH (port 22), a common brute-force target.
- The pattern of rapid, short-lived connections with data transfer matches the behavior of automated brute force scripts trying passwords.
- The flags and data volume indicate authentication attempts, not simple port probes or scans.

If you saw many such flows from the same source to the same destination (or to multiple SSH servers), this would further confirm brute-force activity.


Explanation: 88

Let's break down the provided network flow:

**Flow Attributes:**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:27:25.569  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Src Port:** 34359
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Dest Port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 74
- **TCP Flags:** ....S.  (Only SYN flag set)

**Label:**
- **Classified as:** ""bruteForce""

---

## Analysis

### 1. **What does this flow represent?**
- **TCP SYN packet**: The only flag set is SYN, meaning this is the very first packet in attempting to establish a TCP connection (part of the 3-way handshake).
- **Destination port 22**: Port 22 is the default port for SSH.
- **1 packet, 74 bytes, duration 0.0**: This is just a single SYN packet, and no reply (SYN-ACK or RST) is recorded yet.

### 2. **Why would this be classified as ""bruteForce""?**
- **SSH brute force attacks** typically involve repeatedly trying to connect to the SSH service (port 22) in order to guess passwords or keys.
- If the system sees **many SYN packets to port 22** from the same source IP (or possibly multiple source IPs, depending on the attack), this is often a clear indicator of a brute force attack in progress.
- **A single SYN packet** to port 22 **alone** is not sufficient evidence of brute force. However, in the context of flow-based intrusion detection, this flow could be one of **many** similar flows seen from this source IP to port 22, indicating repeated SSH login attempts.

### 3. **Why not another label?**
- **""dos"" (Denial of Service):** A single SYN packet is not enough for a DoS attack. DoS would involve a much higher volume or repeated attempts to overwhelm the service.
- **""portScan"":** Port scan would involve SYN packets to **many different ports** on the same or different hosts, not repeated packets to port 22.
- **""pingScan"":** Would involve ICMP, not TCP.
- **""---"" (Normal):** Accessing SSH is normal, but if this flow is part of a pattern of repeated attempts, it may be flagged as ""bruteForce"".

---

## **Summary**
**This flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It is a TCP SYN packet attempting to connect to port 22 (SSH), which is commonly targeted in brute force attacks.
- In the context of network flow analysis, flows like this (especially if repeated rapidly from the same source IP to port 22) are indicative of brute force attempts to gain unauthorized access via SSH.
- The system likely saw multiple similar flows and thus classified this one as part of a brute force attack pattern.

> **If this is just a single flow, the label alone is not enough; the classification makes sense when viewed as one of many such flows forming a brute force attack pattern.**

---

**In short:**  
*This flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because it matches the typical pattern of initial TCP SYN attempts to the SSH port (22), which, when repeated, indicate an attempt to guess SSH credentials (a brute force attack).*


Explanation: 89

Let's analyze your network flow and the **""bruteForce""** classification:

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 12:38:47.414  
- **Duration:** 0.705 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.100.4  
- **Source port:** 22 (**SSH**)  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Dest port:** 51857  
- **Packets:** 11  
- **Bytes:** 2085  
- **TCP Flags:** `.AP.S.` (ACK, PSH, SYN)

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### 1. **Port 22 (SSH) Usage**
- The source port is **22**, which is the default port for SSH.
- SSH is a common target for brute force attacks because attackers often try to guess usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access.

#### 2. **Flow Direction**
- The source port is 22, suggesting this flow **originated from the SSH server** (192.168.100.4) and is going to a high-numbered ephemeral port (51857) on 192.168.220.16.
- This likely means this is a **server-to-client response** flow, possibly in reply to an SSH connection attempt.

#### 3. **Number of Packets and Bytes**
- 11 packets, 2085 bytes, in less than a second.
- This is a somewhat moderate activity for an SSH flow, possibly indicating a quick attempt (with little actual session data exchanged).

#### 4. **TCP Flags**
- **.AP.S.** means: **ACK, PSH, SYN**
  - The presence of **SYN** indicates the start of a connection.
  - **ACK** and **PSH** suggest data was pushed quickly after connection establishment.
- This pattern is common in scripted or automated connection attempts.

#### 5. **Brute Force Attack Characteristics**
- **BruteForce** attacks involve multiple, rapid login attempts in a short period.
- They often target services with authentication, like SSH.
- Even a single flow can be indicative if the overall context (e.g., many such flows in a short period) is considered, but even individually, an SSH connection with a rapid, automated handshake can be suspicious.

### Why **""bruteForce""**?

- **SSH (port 22) is a common brute force target.**
- **Short duration and multiple packets** suggest a failed or incomplete connection, characteristic of brute force attempts (many rapid, unsuccessful tries).
- **SYN, ACK, and PSH flags** indicate a quick attempt to establish and send data, possibly an automated tool.
- If this flow is part of a series of flows (not shown here) with similar patterns, it would strongly indicate brute force activity.
- **No evidence of normal traffic or large data transfer** that would indicate a legitimate SSH session.

---

## **Summary Explanation**

> **This network flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is an SSH (port 22) connection attempt with a quick series of packets and bytes, showing signs of automated connection and data transmission typical of brute force attacks. The combination of TCP flags, port usage, and short duration fits the profile of a brute force attempt rather than normal usage, DoS, or scanning activity.**

If you have more flows, you would likely see many such flows in succession—a hallmark of brute force activity.


Explanation: 90

Let's **analyze the network flow** provided and the classification as `""bruteForce""`:

---

### **Flow Attributes Recap**

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-20 10:30:26.035  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source Port:** 34373  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8  
- **Destination Port:** 22 (SSH)  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 74  
- **TCP Flags:** ....S. (Only SYN set)

---

### **What does this flow represent?**

- **A single TCP SYN packet** from 192.168.220.16:34373 to 192.168.200.8:22 (SSH).
- No response (duration is 0.0, 1 packet only, no ACK or other flags).
- This is the **start of a TCP connection attempt** to SSH.

---

### **How are brute force attacks generally detected in flows?**

- **Brute force attacks** (in this context, likely SSH brute force) involve:
  - **Multiple successive connection attempts** to a service (e.g., SSH on port 22), often with varying credentials.
  - Typically, you'll see many SYN packets or completed handshakes to port 22, possibly from the same or different source IPs/ports.

---

### **Why might this flow be classified as ""bruteForce""?**

#### **Possible Explanations:**

1. **Contextual Flow Analysis**  
   - **If this flow is part of a sequence** of many similar connection attempts from this source IP (or many source ports) to port 22 on the same destination, it would fit the pattern of a brute-force attack.
   - **However, this flow alone** (single SYN to port 22) does not itself constitute a brute force attack.  
   - The classification likely **depends on the surrounding flows**—i.e., this is one of many, and the overall pattern is classified as brute force.

2. **Port 22 as a Target**  
   - Port 22 is well-known for SSH, a common target for credential brute-forcing.
   - Flows to port 22, especially many in a short time, are often flagged as brute force attempts.

3. **Rule-Based Classifier**  
   - The classifier might have a rule such as: ""Any flow to port 22 from an external IP is part of a brute-force attempt,"" especially in lab/CTF datasets or if accompanied by many similar flows.

---

### **Why NOT the other labels?**

- **""---"" (Normal):**  
  - A single SYN to port 22 could be normal, but in this dataset, it appears to be part of an attack pattern.
- **""dos"":**  
  - DOS is characterized by high volumes to overwhelm the target, not just a SYN to SSH.
- **""portScan"":**  
  - A port scan would typically involve SYNs to many different ports, not just port 22.
- **""pingScan"":**  
  - Would involve ICMP packets, not TCP SYN to port 22.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Flow Attribute         | Brute Force Relevance                                        |
|----------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dest Port: 22 (SSH)    | Typical target of brute force attacks                       |
| TCP SYN packet         | Start of new SSH connection attempt                         |
| Packets: 1             | Might be one of many in a brute force pattern               |
| Only SYN flag          | Indicates connection attempt, not established session        |
| Duration: 0.0          | No further communication, likely many such attempts         |
| Context (not shown)    | Likely part of a larger sequence of such attempts           |

---

## **Final Explanation**

> **This network flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a TCP SYN packet attempting to initiate an SSH (port 22) connection. While a single SYN alone is not enough to constitute a brute force attack, such flows are typically part of a sequence of many rapid connection attempts to the SSH service, which is characteristic of brute force attacks. The classifier likely recognized this pattern across multiple similar flows, and thus labeled this one as part of a brute force attack.**

---

**If you have more context or a sequence of such flows, the explanation becomes stronger. But based on this single flow's features and destination port, this is the reasoning.**


Explanation: 91

Let's analyze the flow data and the rationale for classifying it as **""bruteForce""**:

---

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-20 12:39:11.540  
- **Duration:** 0.007 seconds (7 ms)
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 52051  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.100.4  
- **Dest port:** 22.0 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 5  
- **Bytes:** 610  
- **TCP Flags:** .AP..F (ACK, PSH, FIN)

---

### Analysis

#### 1. **Destination Port (22)**
- **Port 22** is the default port for **SSH** (Secure Shell), a common target for brute-force attacks, as attackers often try to guess login credentials.

#### 2. **Short Duration, Multiple Packets**
- The flow lasted **7 milliseconds** but exchanged **5 packets** and **610 bytes**.  
- This is consistent with automated tools attempting rapid login attempts rather than a normal, interactive SSH session (which usually lasts longer and exchanges more data over time).

#### 3. **TCP Flags: .AP..F**
- **A (ACK)** and **P (PSH)**: This combination is typical of application data being sent (e.g., login attempts).
- **F (FIN)**: Indicates the end of the connection.
- Absence of **SYN** means this is not the very first packet in the session, but a short-lived data exchange.
- The lack of **R (RST)** suggests the session wasn't forcefully reset, but closed properly.

#### 4. **Flow Characteristics vs. Attack Types**
- **DoS:** Typically involves a large number of packets/bytes or many parallel flows to overwhelm a service, not a short, small flow.
- **PortScan:** Would involve connections to many different ports, not a single port (22).
- **PingScan:** Would use ICMP, not TCP/22.
- **BruteForce:** Involves repeated (often automated) login attempts to a service (like SSH) in a short time. This flow's characteristics (port 22, multiple packets, short duration) fit this pattern.
- **--- (Normal):** A normal SSH session would likely last longer, with more packets/data, and more varied flag behavior.

---

### **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It targets **SSH (port 22)**, a common brute-force target.
- It involves a short, rapid exchange (suggesting automation, as in brute-force tools).
- It sends data (likely login attempts) and then closes the connection quickly.
- The packet/byte count and TCP flags indicate a quick connect-send-disconnect pattern typical of automated login attempts, not a normal user session.

**In summary:**  
> **The flow matches the pattern of a brute-force attack: rapid, repeated, short-lived login attempts on SSH.**

If you have more flows or need to distinguish different attack types based on network flow, similar logic can be applied by analyzing port, duration, protocol, flags, and volume characteristics.


Explanation: 92

Let's break down the flow attributes:

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:49:19.632  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 40322  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.8  
- **Dest port:** 22  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 74  
- **Flags:** ....S. (only SYN flag set)

And it was labeled as: **""bruteForce""**

---

### Explanation

#### 1. **Port 22 (SSH)**
- **Port 22** is the default port for **SSH** (Secure Shell), a common target for brute-force login attempts.

#### 2. **SYN-only packet**
- The only TCP flag set is **SYN**, indicating this is the **start of a TCP connection** (a connection attempt).
- Duration is **0.0** and only **one packet** (74 bytes), which strongly suggests this is a single connection attempt, not a full session.

#### 3. **Why not the other labels?**
- **""---"" (Normal):**  
  A single SYN to port 22 could be normal, but context is key.  
- **""dos"" (Denial of Service):**  
  DOS typically involves large numbers of packets or many connections to exhaust resources. This is a single packet.
- **""portScan"":**  
  Port scans typically involve SYN packets sent to **many different ports** on the same host to discover open ports. Here, only port 22 is targeted.
- **""pingScan"":**  
  A ping scan would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **""bruteForce"":**  
  **Brute-force attacks** on SSH often involve repeated connection attempts to port 22, each attempt trying a different password or username. If multiple such SYN packets are seen from the same source to port 22, this is a classic brute-force pattern.

#### 4. **Why was this single flow classified as bruteForce?**
- In some network flow datasets or intrusion detection systems, **even a single SYN to port 22 from a suspicious or external source** can be labeled as ""bruteForce"" because:
  - It may be part of a larger set of attempts (each recorded as a separate flow).
  - **Feature-based detection:** The classifier may only see individual flows, and if it sees a SYN to port 22, it tags it as ""bruteForce"" because it's a common brute-force signature.
  - **Ground-truth labeling:** The dataset may have labeled all SSH connection attempts from certain sources as brute-force, even if each flow is just a single SYN.

---

## **Summary**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it represents a SYN connection attempt to port 22 (SSH), which is a standard pattern for brute-force attacks on SSH services. Even though it is a single packet, in flow-based detection (especially in labeled datasets), such patterns are often used to indicate brute-force activity, assuming that many such attempts are made in quick succession.**

> **In short:**  
> **A TCP SYN to port 22 is a strong indicator of an SSH brute-force attack, especially when observed as part of multiple similar attempts. This flow matches that pattern.**

If you need an explanation tailored to a human reader (e.g., for a report), let me know!


Explanation: 93

Let's analyze the flow and see why it might have been classified as **""bruteForce""**.

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 11:04:19.915
- **Duration:** 0.0
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Src port:** 57542
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Dest port:** 22.0 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 74
- **Flags:** ....S. (SYN flag only)

### What does this flow represent?

- **TCP SYN packet:** The flow consists of a single TCP packet with only the SYN flag set. This is the very first step in establishing a TCP connection (the ""SYN"" in the TCP three-way handshake).
- **Destination port 22:** This is the standard port for SSH services.
- **From a non-local source IP to a server:** The source is trying to initiate a connection to an SSH server.

---

## Why ""bruteForce""?

### Typical Indicators of Brute Force Attacks

A **brute force attack** on SSH usually involves repeatedly trying to connect to the SSH service (port 22), possibly with different usernames and passwords, hoping to guess the correct credentials. In network flows, this often manifests as:

- Multiple connection attempts to port 22 from the same or different source IPs
- Many short-lived flows, often with only the SYN flag (indicating failed or incomplete connections)
- A pattern of repeated access to SSH in a short time window

### Why this flow *could* be labeled as ""bruteForce"":

- **Port 22 is targeted:** The SSH service is a common target for brute force attacks.
- **SYN-only flow, duration 0, 1 packet:** This suggests a connection attempt was made, but no response was received, or the handshake did not complete. Brute force tools often rapidly open and close connections, or are blocked after the initial SYN.
- **If many such flows occur:** If this flow is part of a pattern—dozens or hundreds of such SYN attempts from the same IP to port 22—it strongly suggests an automated brute force attack.
- **Automated detection systems:** Many IDS/IPS systems and datasets label *all* SYN attempts to SSH from unusual or external sources as ""bruteForce"" if they occur in high frequency, or if they match known attack patterns.

---

## Why *this* Single Flow?

On its own, **a single SYN packet to port 22 is not enough to definitively say it's a brute force attack**—it could be a legitimate connection attempt. However, in labeled datasets, individual flows are often labeled based on the overall context or pattern in which they appear:

- The system might have seen **many** such flows from this IP to port 22 in a short time window, and so *all* those flows (even individual ones) are labeled ""bruteForce"".
- The labeling may be part of a dataset where all such SYNs to SSH were pre-labeled as brute force as part of a simulated attack scenario.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute      | Value                    | Relevance to bruteForce |
|----------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Dest port      | 22 (SSH)                 | Common attack target   |
| Flags          | SYN only                 | Initiating connection, typical for brute force attempts |
| Packets/Bytes  | 1 / 74                   | Short, incomplete connection, typical for failed attempts |
| Duration       | 0.0                      | No full connection established |
| Context        | (Implied multiple such flows) | Typical in brute force attacks |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it matches the pattern of an SSH brute force attack:**
- An attempted connection (SYN) to the SSH port (22), likely as part of a repeated series of such attempts from the same source.
- Minimal traffic and no handshake completion, which is typical of automated brute force tools that rapidly try many logins.
- In datasets, even single such flows may be labeled as ""bruteForce"" if they appear in the context of an attack.

*If you see many such flows in your logs, it's almost certainly an SSH brute force attempt.*  
If this is an isolated flow, the label may be due to the context in which it was captured or the way the dataset was constructed.

---

### **In short:**
> It was likely classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a TCP SYN packet to port 22 (SSH)—a common target for brute force login attacks—possibly as part of many such attempts from the same IP in a short period.


Explanation: 94

Let's analyze the provided network flow and the classification:

---

#### **Flow Attributes**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:51:56.090
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source port:** 41480
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Destination port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 74
- **Flags:** ....S. (Only SYN flag is set)

---

### **Analysis**

#### **What does this flow represent?**
- This is a single TCP packet with only the SYN flag set.  
- Source is initiating a connection to port 22 (SSH) on the destination.
- No data is transferred (only a SYN packet, typical of the start of a TCP handshake).

#### **Why might someone classify this as ""bruteForce""?**
- **Brute Force attacks** (on SSH) often manifest as repeated attempts to connect to the SSH port (22) in order to guess credentials.
- However, **a single SYN packet by itself** does **not** constitute a brute-force attack. It is just the beginning of a connection attempt.
- **Brute-force detection** is usually based on seeing **multiple such flows** from the same source to the same destination port (SSH), indicating repeated login attempts.
- This single flow could be just one connection attempt (possibly as part of a larger sequence).

---

### **Why this classification may be questionable**

- **Isolated Event:** This flow *alone* does not provide enough context for brute-force; it could be a normal connection attempt to SSH.
- **No Evidence of Multiple Attempts:** Brute-force typically involves many such connection attempts in a short time.
- **Only SYN Packet:** No actual login attempt or data transfer is visible here; it’s just the start of a connection.

---

### **More Likely Classification**
- **""---"" (No attack, normal flow):** The safest, most accurate label for a single SYN packet to a service port is ""normal"", unless there is broader context (e.g., many such flows in a short time from this IP to port 22).

---

### **Possible Reason for Misclassification**

- The classifier may be using **heuristics** such as ""ANY SYN to port 22 is brute-force,"" which would be an **overly aggressive** rule.
- If this flow is part of a **larger set of similar flows** (i.e., many SYNs to port 22 from the same source), then labeling as ""bruteForce"" makes sense. However, with just this one flow, it's insufficient.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute       | Value                      | Typical meaning for attack detection          |
|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Dest port       | 22                         | SSH (Brute-force target)                     |
| TCP Flags       | SYN only                   | Start of connection (possible brute-force if repeated) |
| Number packets  | 1                          | Only handshake started                       |
| Bytes           | 74                         | Typical for SYN packet                       |
| Duration        | 0.0                        | Single packet, no established connection     |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" most likely because:**
- It targets port 22 (SSH), which is a common brute-force target.
- It is a TCP SYN packet, which initiates a connection (possibly the start of an attack).

**However, with the information provided (a single SYN packet), the classification is likely an overgeneralization. Brute-force attacks are typically characterized by a series of such attempts, not a single one.**

**If this flow is part of a sequence of similar flows, then the classification makes sense. Otherwise, it is likely a false positive.**

---

**In summary:**  
*The flow was likely classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a connection attempt (SYN packet) to the SSH port (22), which is a common target for such attacks. However, this single flow alone does not constitute brute-force activity; such classification should be based on repeated attempts.*


Explanation: 95

Certainly! Let's break down the network flow attributes and analyze why it was classified as a **""bruteForce""** attack:

---

### **Network Flow Summary**
- **Start Time:** 2017-03-21 13:21:56.967  
- **Duration:** 0.156 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.200.4  
- **Source Port:** 22  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Destination Port:** 44771  
- **Packets:** 11  
- **Bytes:** 2085  
- **Flags:** .AP.S. (ACK, PSH, SYN)

---

## **Analysis**

### **1. Source Port 22 (SSH)**
- **Port 22** is the default port for **SSH (Secure Shell)**, a service commonly targeted by brute force attacks because attackers try to guess login credentials.

### **2. Short Duration, Multiple Packets**
- The flow lasted **0.156 seconds** but included **11 packets** and **2085 bytes** of data.
- This suggests a burst of rapid communication attempts, possibly multiple authentication tries within a short time.

### **3. TCP Flags: .AP.S.**
- **Flags:** The sequence shows **ACK (A)**, **PSH (P)**, and **SYN (S)** flags set at different times during the flow.
    - **SYN** is used to initiate a connection.
    - **PSH** pushes data to the recipient immediately (often used to send credentials).
    - **ACK** acknowledges received data.
- The combination suggests a normal connection setup (SYN), data transfer (PSH), and acknowledgment (ACK) — consistent with repeated login attempts or fast session initiations.

### **4. Direction of Traffic**
- **Src port 22 → Dst port 44771**: SSH server at 192.168.200.4 is communicating with a client at 192.168.220.16.
- However, it's common for logs to record flows from the server's perspective, especially when a client connects to SSH (server replies from port 22 to client's ephemeral port).

### **5. Brute Force Attack Characteristics**
- **Brute force attacks on SSH** are characterized by:
    - Many short-lived connections or bursts of authentication attempts.
    - Multiple packets in a short duration.
    - Use of the SSH port (22).
    - Data transfer (credentials attempts).
    - No evidence of port scanning (which would touch many ports), nor DoS (which would be high-volume traffic), nor ping scan (which would use ICMP).

---

## **Why ""bruteForce""?**

### **Key Points:**
- **SSH port used:** Typical brute force target.
- **Multiple packets/bytes in short time:** Suggests repeated attempts, not a single session.
- **TCP flags and session pattern:** Consistent with repeated connection attempts and data transfers.
- **Not fitting other attack types:**  
    - **Not ""dos""**: Traffic is not high enough for a denial of service.
    - **Not ""portScan"" or ""pingScan""**: Only one port involved, and protocol is TCP, not ICMP.
    - **Not ""---"" (normal):** The number of packets and bytes in such a short time is abnormal for a single SSH session.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute     | Value                     | BruteForce Indicator?         |
|---------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Src port      | 22 (SSH)                  | YES (target of brute force)  |
| Duration      | 0.156s                    | YES (very short, bursty)     |
| Packets       | 11                        | YES (multiple attempts)      |
| Bytes         | 2085                      | YES (multiple data bursts)   |
| TCP Flags     | .AP.S.                    | YES (session setup + data)   |
| Dest port     | 44771 (ephemeral)         | YES (typical client port)    |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- It involves multiple, rapid SSH (port 22) connection attempts within a very short time.
- The pattern of packets, bytes, and TCP flags matches typical brute-force attack behavior, where an attacker tries multiple credential combinations in quick succession.

If you have further details (such as multiple similar flows over time), the evidence would be even stronger for a brute-force attack. But even with this single flow, the characteristics are a strong match.


Explanation: 96

Let's **analyze the provided network flow** and its classification as ""bruteForce"":

### **Network Flow Details**

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:48:35.383
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Protocol:** UDP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source port:** 138
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.255
- **Destination port:** 138.0
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 262
- **Flags:** ......

### **What does this flow represent?**

#### 1. **UDP port 138**
- UDP port 138 is used for **NetBIOS Datagram Service**, commonly used for Windows network communications (such as file sharing and network browsing).

#### 2. **Destination IP: 192.168.220.255**
- Ending in `.255` suggests this is a **broadcast address** for the subnet. NetBIOS Name Service and Datagram Service often use broadcasts to communicate with all hosts on a subnet.

#### 3. **Single packet, 262 bytes**
- Only one packet is sent, which is typical for broadcast NetBIOS announcements or discovery messages.

#### 4. **Flags**
- The flags are TCP flags, but this is a UDP flow (flags would not be relevant for UDP).

---

### **Classification Explanation**

#### **Your classifier labeled this as ""bruteForce""**

#### **Why this is likely incorrect:**
- **Bruteforce attacks** usually involve multiple connection attempts to a specific service/port, often over TCP (e.g., SSH, RDP, FTP), trying different credentials.
- This flow is:
  - Only **1 UDP packet**
  - To a **broadcast address**
  - On **NetBIOS Datagram Service** (not a typical bruteforce target)
  - **No evidence of multiple attempts** or login failures.

#### **Why might a classifier make this mistake?**
- **Feature confusion:** The classifier might be overfitting to certain ports (e.g., 138) or broadcast behavior.
- **Incorrect labeling in training data:** If training data mislabeled similar flows as ""bruteForce"", the model could repeat that error.
- **Lack of temporal context:** A single flow doesn't represent bruteforce activity, which is defined by repeated attempts over time.

---

### **What is the correct label?**

**This flow is most likely NORMAL (""---"")**, as it represents a standard Windows broadcast message (NetBIOS Datagram Service), not an attack.

---

### **Summary**

**Reason for classification as ""bruteForce"":**
> The classifier likely saw features such as the use of UDP port 138, broadcast communication, or specific byte/packet patterns and incorrectly associated them with bruteForce activity due to limitations or errors in its training process.

**Why this is incorrect:**
> BruteForce attacks involve repeated access attempts, not single broadcast datagrams. This flow is a normal broadcast for Windows networking, not an attack.

---

**In conclusion:**  
The flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" most likely due to a misinterpretation by the classifier of benign NetBIOS broadcast activity as malicious, possibly due to mislabeled data or feature confusion. There is nothing in this flow that matches typical bruteForce attack patterns.


Explanation: 97

Let's analyze the network flow and the classification of **""bruteForce""**:

### **Key Indicators for Brute Force Classification**

#### **1. Source Port 22 (SSH):**
- Source port is **22**, which is the default port for **SSH** (Secure Shell).
- Normally, **destination port** is 22 when connecting *to* an SSH server, but in this case, the source port is 22, which usually indicates a **response** from the SSH server. The connection was likely initiated by the client at port 45527, reaching the server (192.168.200.4) at port 22.

#### **2. Multiple Packets and Bytes:**
- **16 packets** and **2547 bytes** exchanged in just **1.9 seconds** suggests an active session with several attempts or commands.

#### **3. TCP Flags: `.AP.SF`**
- The sequence of flags: **A (ACK), P (PSH), S (SYN), F (FIN)**
    - **SYN**: Connection initiation
    - **ACK**: Acknowledgement of receipt
    - **PSH**: Push function, data sent to application
    - **FIN**: Finish, connection termination
- The presence of **SYN** and **FIN** in the same flow, along with **ACK** and **PSH**, suggests a complete TCP session with data transmission.

#### **4. Destination Port is High (45527):**
- Indicates a client-side ephemeral port. The client initiated the connection to the SSH server.

#### **5. Attack Labels Analysis:**

- **DoS:** Would typically involve very high packet rates and/or repeated connections aimed at overwhelming a service.
- **PortScan / PingScan:** Would involve many destination ports or ICMP probes, not a single SSH session.
- **BruteForce:** Involves repeated login attempts over protocols like SSH, often within a short period, as attackers try many password combinations.
- **No Attack:** Would normally show standard usage patterns, typically with fewer packets and bytes for a successful login, or from trusted sources.

#### **6. Contextual Clues:**
- The use of SSH, multiple packets in a short time, and the presence of both data and session setup/teardown, are all indicative of **multiple login attempts**.
- If this flow is one of many similar flows from the same source to the SSH service, it's characteristic of brute force attacks, where an attacker tries to guess credentials by making rapid, repeated login attempts.

---

### **Summary: Why ""bruteForce""?**

This flow is typical of an **SSH brute force attack** because:
- It involves traffic to the SSH port (22).
- There are multiple packets and data transferred in a very short time.
- The sequence of TCP flags indicates a full session with data exchanged (likely login attempts).
- Such patterns are distinct from other attacks (DoS, scanning) and from normal user behavior.

**Therefore, the flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it matches the typical signature of repeated, automated SSH login attempts, characteristic of brute force attacks.**

Explanation: 98

Let's analyze the network flow in detail:

**Flow Attributes:**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 11:22:42.153  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16 | **Source Port:** 59423  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8 | **Destination Port:** 22  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 74  
- **TCP Flags:** ....S.  (SYN only)  

**Classified as:** `bruteForce` attack

---

## Why could this flow be classified as ""bruteForce""?

### 1. **Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
- Port 22 is the default port for SSH, a protocol commonly targeted by brute force attacks as attackers try to guess passwords to gain unauthorized access.

### 2. **SYN Packet (....S.)**
- The only flag set is SYN (“S”), which means this is a connection initiation attempt.  
- In many network traffic datasets, a brute force attack is often detected by observing numerous SYN packets to the SSH port from a single source IP (or multiple sources), indicating repeated login attempts.

### 3. **Single Packet, Short Duration**
- This flow is for a single connection initiation attempt (1 packet, 74 bytes, duration 0.0).  
- On its own, this might not be enough to classify as brute force. However, in labeled datasets or intrusion detection systems, even a single SYN attempt to port 22 **can be labeled as brute force if it is part of a larger pattern**.

### 4. **Dataset Labeling Practice**
- In many cybersecurity datasets (such as CICIDS, UNSW-NB15), **flows where a source IP sends many SYN packets to destination port 22 in a short period are labeled as brute force**.
- Sometimes, every SYN attempt to port 22 from a host known to be attacking (in the dataset scenario) is labeled as brute force, even if shown in isolation.

---

## **Explanation**

**This flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because:**
- The source IP is attempting to connect to port 22 (SSH) on the destination, which is a common target for brute force password attacks.
- The connection attempt is a SYN packet, which is the first step in establishing a TCP connection—consistent with the start of a login attempt.
- In the context of typical intrusion detection datasets, such flows are labeled ""bruteForce"" if the same source is seen making repeated connection attempts to port 22, as would happen in a brute force attack.
- Even if only a single flow is shown here, the label may be inherited from the broader pattern in the dataset.

| Attribute         | Value                    | Relevance to Brute Force Label         |
|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Dest Port         | 22 (SSH)                | Common brute force target              |
| TCP Flags         | SYN only                | TCP connection initiation (login try)  |
| Packet Count      | 1                       | One attempt; label may reflect broader pattern |
| Duration          | 0.0                     | Instant attempt                        |

---

**In short:**  
*This flow is labeled ""bruteForce"" because it is a connection attempt (SYN packet) to port 22 (SSH), which is a common vector for brute force attacks — especially when many such attempts are seen from the same source. The labeling most likely reflects this flow being part of a sequence of similar attempts, characteristic of brute force SSH attacks.*


Explanation: 99

Let's analyze the provided flow data and its classification as **""bruteForce""**:

---

### **Flow Attributes:**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 11:15:16.947
- **Duration:** 0.0
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Src port:** 59405
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Dest port:** 22.0 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 74
- **TCP Flags:** ....S. (only SYN flag set)

---

### **Flow Analysis**

#### **What does the flow represent?**
- **TCP SYN packet**: The only flag set is SYN (`....S.`), which means this is the first step of establishing a TCP connection.
- **Destination port 22**: This is the default port for SSH, which is a common target for brute-force attacks.
- **One packet, 74 bytes, duration 0**: This is a single TCP SYN attempt (possibly part of a scan or attack).

#### **Why could this be labeled as ""bruteForce""?**

- **Brute-force attacks on SSH** typically involve repeatedly trying to connect to port 22 with different credentials. However, **this flow alone does not show actual login attempts**—just the initial connection attempt.
- In some datasets or automated labeling systems, **a large number of SYN packets to port 22** from the same source IP (or many source ports) to the same destination IP is characteristic of brute-force attacks, because each connection attempt usually starts with a SYN.
- If this flow is part of a **series of similar flows** (i.e., many SYNs to port 22 from the same source), the system may label each flow as ""bruteForce"" as part of the attack pattern.
- **PortScan** attack is generally characterized by SYN packets to **many different ports**, while ""bruteForce"" is characterized by repeated connections to a single service/port (SSH here).

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | BruteForce Indicator?                         |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Dest port 22      | Yes (SSH is a common brute-force target)     |
| SYN packet        | Yes (connection attempt to SSH)              |
| One packet        | Not necessarily, but could be 1 of many      |
| Src IP ≠ Dest IP  | Yes (external-to-internal attempt)           |
| Duration 0        | Yes (connection not completed)               |

## **Direct Answer**

**This flow is classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a TCP SYN packet (connection attempt) to port 22 (SSH), which is the typical start of an SSH connection. In many datasets, repeated SYNs to SSH (port 22) are indicative of brute-force password-guessing attacks, even if each individual flow only contains a single packet. The labeling likely comes from the context of this being one of many such flows that together represent an SSH brute-force attack.**

**If you have only this flow, the context is limited, but the destination port (22) and the SYN flag are the main reasons for the ""bruteForce"" label.**


Explanation: 100

Let's analyze the flow details:

**Flow attributes:**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 10:41:54.330
- **Duration:** 0.0 (instantaneous, just one packet)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Src port:** 37416
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Dest port:** 22 (SSH)
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 74
- **Flags:** ....S. (only SYN flag set)

**Classification:** ""bruteForce""

---

## Why was this classified as ""bruteForce""?

### 1. **Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
- Port 22 is the default port for **SSH** (Secure Shell), which is often targeted for **brute force attacks** where attackers attempt to guess username/password combinations.

### 2. **SYN flag only (....S.)**
- The flow consists of a **single TCP SYN packet**, which is the first step in establishing a TCP connection.
- A brute force attack on SSH typically involves many connection attempts (many SYN packets) to the SSH service.

### 3. **Single Packet / Instantaneous Duration**
- This flow is only a single packet (the SYN), indicating the beginning of a connection attempt.
- In data collection, individual SYN packets to SSH from the same source to the same destination, particularly in high frequency or high volume, can be indicative of brute force attempts.

### 4. **Possible Labeling Context**
- In many intrusion detection datasets, **repeated SYN packets to port 22 from the same source** are used as evidence of brute force attempts, even if each individual flow is just a single packet.
- The specific flow you provided may be part of a larger sequence, and has been labeled ""bruteForce"" because it matches the pattern: **TCP SYN to SSH**.

---

## Why not other classes?
- **dos:** Denial of service would usually involve many packets, possibly with various flags, and not necessarily targeting SSH specifically.
- **portScan:** Would involve SYNs to **many different destination ports**, not just port 22.
- **pingScan:** Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **Normal flow:** A normal SSH connection would involve more than just a SYN; it would have SYN-ACK, ACK, and subsequent data packets.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute           | Value                          | Brute Force Indicator? |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Dest Port           | 22 (SSH)                      | YES                   |
| TCP Flags           | SYN only                      | YES                   |
| Packets             | 1                             | YES (if repeated)     |
| Protocol            | TCP                           | YES                   |
| Duration            | 0.0                           | YES (just a SYN)      |

---

## **Conclusion**

**The flow was classified as ""bruteForce"" because it is a TCP SYN packet attempting to connect to port 22 (SSH).** In the context of network security, repeated SYN attempts to SSH are a classic signature of brute force attacks, where an attacker tries to establish many connections to guess credentials. Even though this flow is a single packet, in data labeling, such flows are often marked ""bruteForce"" as part of a sequence of brute force attempts."
