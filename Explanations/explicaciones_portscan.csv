portScan,"

Explanation: 1

Let's break down your network flow and see why it was likely classified as a **""portScan""**.

### Attributes of the Flow

- **Start time:** 2017-03-17 17:03:52.601  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source port:** 36920  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.210.5  
- **Destination port:** 5811  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **TCP Flags:** ....S. (Only SYN flag set)  

---

## Why is this a Port Scan?

### 1. **Only SYN flag set (....S.)**
- The **SYN** flag is used to initiate a TCP connection.  
- When only a SYN packet is sent (with no reply, no ACK, etc.), it often means the sender is just probing to see if the port is open, not actually trying to establish a full connection.
- This is a classic technique in port scanning, called a **SYN scan** or ""half-open"" scan.

### 2. **Single Packet, Zero Duration**
- Only **1 packet** was sent, with a **duration of 0.0** seconds.  
- No data is exchanged, just a probe.
- If this happens on many ports or targets, it's a strong sign of scanning activity.

### 3. **TCP Destination Port (5811)**
- The specific port number is less important than the pattern: scanning tools often send SYN packets to many different ports to map which ones are open.

### 4. **No Actual Communication**
- No ACK, RST, or data packets—just the initial SYN.
- In normal traffic, a SYN would be followed by a SYN-ACK and then an ACK (the ""three-way handshake""), but here, only the SYN is present.

---

## How does this differ from other attacks?

- **Brute force**: Multiple login attempts, usually on a single service/port, with longer sessions and more packets.
- **DoS**: High volume of packets, usually to the same target, trying to overwhelm it.
- **Ping scan**: Uses ICMP Echo Requests, not TCP SYN packets.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute                  | Value           | Port Scan Indicator?        |
|----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| TCP Flags                  | ....S.          | SYN scan                    |
| Packets                    | 1               | Yes (just a probe)          |
| Bytes                      | 58              | Minimal (just SYN)          |
| Duration                   | 0.0             | Instantaneous probe         |
| Protocol                   | TCP             | SYN scan uses TCP           |
| No further communication   | Yes             | Typical for scans           |

---

## **Conclusion**

This flow is classified as **""portScan""** because it matches the typical pattern of a TCP SYN scan: a single SYN packet, no further communication, and no response packets. This is a well-known method for discovering open ports on a target system without actually completing the TCP handshake or engaging in any legitimate session, which is the defining trait of a port scan.

**If you saw many such flows, possibly to different ports or IPs, that would further confirm scanning activity.**


Explanation: 2

Let's analyze the flow attributes and why the flow was classified as **""portScan""**:

---

### **Flow Summary**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-21 14:33:15.739
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.210.3, **Src Port:** 6689
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16, **Dst Port:** 52086
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 54
- **Flags:** `.A.R..` (ACK and RST set, others clear)

---

### **Key Details & What They Suggest**

1. **Single Packet, Very Short Duration**
   - Only **one packet** was sent, and the duration is **0.0 seconds**. This is typical of a probing or scanning activity, not a normal connection or data transfer.

2. **TCP Flags: `.A.R..` (ACK + RST)**
   - The combination of **ACK and RST** flags is commonly seen as a response to a probe. For example, if a host receives a SYN to a closed port, it often responds with a RST (reset). Sometimes an ACK may be set as well. This is not a flag combination typical of normal application traffic.

3. **Unusual Destination Port**
   - The destination port (**52086**) is very high and non-standard, which is not typical for legitimate services. Port scans often target a wide range of ports, including high, non-standard ones.

4. **No Data Transferred**
   - Only header bytes (54 bytes, likely just the TCP/IP header), with no actual payload.

---

### **Why ""portScan"" and Not Other Labels?**

- **Not ""dos""**: A Denial of Service (DoS) attack involves a high volume of traffic or repeated requests meant to overwhelm a system. Here, we see only one packet.
- **Not ""bruteForce""**: Brute force attacks involve repeated login attempts or authentication tries; this flow shows no such pattern.
- **Not ""pingScan""**: A ping scan would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **Not ""---"" (Normal)**: Normal flows typically involve more than one packet, have a longer duration, exchange data, and use standard flags (e.g., SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, etc.).

---

### **Conclusion:**
**Port scans** are performed to discover open ports on a host. Scanners send packets (often SYN, sometimes other flag combinations) to a series of ports and observe the responses (e.g., RST, SYN-ACK). The observed response here (a single TCP packet with ACK and RST, on a high port, with no data, and a duration of 0) matches how a port scan would be detected in flow data.

#### **Therefore:**
> **This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it matches the typical characteristics of a port scan: a single, short-lived TCP packet to a non-standard port, with reset flags, and no data transferred—indicative of a port being probed for openness rather than a real connection attempt.**


Explanation: 3

Let's break down the flow attributes and explain why it was classified as **""portScan""**:

---

### Flow Attributes

- **Start time**: 2017-03-17 13:29:44.549
- **Duration**: 0.0 seconds
- **Proto**: TCP
- **Src IP**: 192.168.220.16
- **Src port**: 61477
- **Dest IP**: 192.168.100.1
- **Dest port**: 49163
- **Packets**: 1
- **Bytes**: 58
- **Flags**: ....S. (Only SYN flag set)

---

## Key Points

### 1. **Single Packet with SYN Flag**
- The flow contains **only one packet** (`Packets: 1`).
- The only TCP flag set is **SYN** (`Flags: ....S.`), which means this is an attempt to initiate a TCP connection (the ""SYN"" in the classic TCP 3-way handshake).

### 2. **No Response / No Handshake**
- **Duration is 0.0** and only 1 packet, indicating that **no response** was received from the destination. This suggests the connection attempt was not completed (no SYN-ACK, no data exchange).

### 3. **Common in Port Scanning**
- Port scans typically send a SYN packet to a target port to check if it's open. If the port is open, the target replies with a SYN-ACK; if not, it may reply with RST or ignore it.
- Scanners often send **multiple SYNs to different ports or hosts** and don't complete the handshake, just checking which ports are open or closed.

### 4. **Not DOS, BruteForce, or PingScan**
- **DoS** attacks involve large volumes of traffic, often multiple packets and/or connections per second.
- **BruteForce** involves repeated authentication attempts (usually with multiple packets and longer durations).
- **PingScan** would involve ICMP, not TCP SYN packets.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute           | Value     | PortScan Explanation                      |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| Packets             | 1         | Only one attempt, matches scan behavior   |
| Flags               | ....S.    | SYN flag, typical for port scan           |
| Bytes               | 58        | Typical size for SYN packet               |
| Duration            | 0.0       | No handshake, no data exchange            |
| Protocol            | TCP       | Port scans usually use TCP SYN            |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**  
- It is a single SYN packet (no handshake, no data transfer)  
- This is the typical signature of a port scanning tool probing to see if a port is open  
- There are no signs of DoS, BruteForce, or PingScan patterns in this flow.

**In short:**  
> **A single TCP SYN packet with no response is a classic indicator of a port scan attempt.**

---

If you observe many similar flows from the same source to different destination ports or IPs, this would further confirm a port scan activity.


Explanation: 4

Let's analyze your network flow and explain why it was classified as **""portScan""**.

**Flow Attributes:**
- **Proto:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.100.5, **Src port:** 5221
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16, **Dest port:** 50150
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 54
- **Flags:** .A.R..
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds

### What does this flow show?

- **A single TCP packet** was sent from the source to the destination.
- The packet size is **very small (54 bytes)**, typical for a TCP control packet (without data).
- **Flags:** "".A.R.."" translates to **ACK and RST** set (no URG, no PSH, no SYN, no FIN). That means the packet had the ACK and RST flags set.
- **Duration 0.0:** Indicates this was an instantaneous event, not an ongoing connection.
- **Only 1 packet:** No actual data exchange, just a single TCP packet.

### What is a TCP RST+ACK packet?

- A TCP packet with the **RST** (Reset) flag is used to abruptly terminate a connection or respond to unexpected or unsolicited packets.
- If a host receives a TCP connection attempt on a port where no service is listening, it will often respond with an **RST** packet.

### Why classify as ""portScan""?

A **port scan** attack is when an attacker tries to discover open ports and services on a target machine by sending connection attempts to many different ports.

#### Typical signs of a port scan:
- Many connection attempts, often to different ports (but each flow individually will look similar to this one).
- Most attempts result in **no proper connection**; instead, the server responds with a RST packet (meaning ""nothing is listening here"").
- Each flow is **very short (often 1 packet, 0 duration)**, with no data exchanged.

#### In your flow:
- **Only 1 packet** (no connection established).
- **RST+ACK** flags (the most common response when scanning a closed port).
- **No data exchanged; duration is 0.0**.
- The destination port is a **high-numbered, uncommon port** (50150), often targeted during port scans.

### Why not other attack types?
- **No attack (""---""):** Normal connections involve SYN and ACK packets, and usually multiple packets (for data exchange). This flow is not a normal connection.
- **DoS, BruteForce, PingScan:** These involve many packets, higher traffic volumes, or ICMP, none of which are seen here.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute        | Observation        | PortScan Indicator? |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Packets          | 1                 | Yes                 |
| Duration         | 0.0               | Yes                 |
| Flags            | .A.R.. (RST+ACK)  | Yes                 |
| Dest port        | High/unusual      | Often               |
| No data exchanged| Yes               | Yes                 |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This network flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**
- It consists of a single TCP packet (no connection).
- The packet was a RST+ACK (typical response to a port scan probe on a closed port).
- No data was exchanged (duration 0, 1 packet).
- This matches the signature of a port scan: a series of probes to various ports to check which ones are open, typically resulting in RST responses for closed ports.

**If you saw many such flows in a short time, each to different ports, it would be a classic port scan pattern.**


Explanation: 5

Certainly! Let's break down the attributes of the network flow and explain why it was classified as **""portScan""**:

---

### **Flow Attributes:**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-17 17:46:57.218  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source port:** 36920  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.210.5  
- **Destination port:** 4445  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S.  (**SYN** flag set, others not set)

---

### **Key Details for Classification**

#### 1. **Single TCP Packet with SYN Flag**
- The flags field is **....S.**, which means **only the SYN flag is set**.
- In TCP connections, the SYN flag is used to initiate a connection (i.e., it's the first step in the TCP three-way handshake).
- There is **only 1 packet** and the flow **duration is 0.0 seconds**, meaning there was **no response** from the destination (no handshake completed).

#### 2. **No Data Exchange, Just an Attempt**
- Only 1 packet sent, 58 bytes (typical for a SYN packet with no payload).
- No ACK, FIN, or data transfer occurred.

#### 3. **PortScan Behavior**
- **Port scanning** is a technique used to discover open ports on a target host by sending SYN packets to various ports and waiting for responses.
- In a port scan, the attacker sends SYN packets to a range of ports (sometimes from the same or different source ports), and records which ports respond (open/closed/filtered).
- **If a system sees many SYN packets to different ports or even a single SYN packet to an unusual port, it may flag this as a port scan.**

#### 4. **Destination Port**
- The destination port, 4445, is not a well-known port, which might also indicate scanning for non-standard or less-used services.

#### 5. **No Attack, but Reconnaissance**
- No further traffic (no data transfer, no connection established), so not DoS, brute force, or ping scan.
- **PingScan** would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **BruteForce** would involve multiple attempts to login/authenticate, which would show multiple packets and possibly established connections.
- **DoS** would involve a high volume of packets, often to overwhelm the target.

---

### **Summary: Why ""portScan""?**

- **SYN scan** is a common port scanning technique, where attackers send a SYN packet and wait for a reply. If they get a SYN-ACK, the port is open. If RST, it's closed. If nothing, it's filtered.
- Your flow:
  - Sent **one SYN packet** (..S..)
  - To a **non-standard port**
  - **No response received**
  - **No further packets**
- This matches the classic signature of a **single probe during a port scan**.

---

## **Conclusion**

**This network flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it consists of a single TCP SYN packet sent to a specific port, with no response or further communication, matching the behavior of a SYN scan used in port scanning attacks to discover open ports on a target host.**

---

**If you have more flows from the same source IP to different destination ports in a short time, it would further confirm the ""portScan"" activity.**


Explanation: 6

Let's break down the flow attributes and the reasoning behind its classification as **""portScan""**:

---

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-21 13:00:00.551  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Proto:** ICMP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 0  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.235  
- **Dest port:** 8.0  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 42  
- **Flags:** ......  

---

### Key Observations

#### 1. **ICMP Protocol**
- The flow uses the **ICMP** protocol, not TCP or UDP.
- ICMP is typically used for network diagnostics (e.g., ping).

#### 2. **Source and Destination Ports**
- **Src port:** 0
- **Dest port:** 8.0

  For ICMP, the concept of source/destination *ports* does not apply the same way as for TCP/UDP.  
  Instead, ICMP uses **type and code**.  
  - ICMP type 8 = Echo Request (used by `ping`).
  - ICMP type 0 = Echo Reply.

  The dest port ""8.0"" here most likely refers to **ICMP type 8, code 0**.

#### 3. **Number of Packets and Bytes**
- Only **1 packet** sent, **42 bytes**.

#### 4. **Flags**
- All dots: `......`, indicating no TCP flags are set (as expected for ICMP).

---

### Why not ""dos"", ""bruteForce"", or ""pingScan""?

- **Not ""dos"" (Denial of Service):**
  - Typically, DoS involves **many packets**/bytes in a short time targeting a service.
  - Here, only a **single packet** is observed.

- **Not ""bruteForce"":**
  - Brute force attacks involve attempts to guess passwords, usually against a service like SSH, FTP, etc., using TCP.

- **Not ""pingScan"":**
  - ""pingScan"" usually refers to scanning *multiple hosts* with ICMP Echo Requests to see which hosts are alive.
  - This flow is a **single ICMP Echo Request** to a single host.

---

### Why ""portScan""?

- In some intrusion detection datasets and systems, **ICMP Echo Requests with type 8, code 0** are interpreted as probes to check if a host or certain services are reachable.
- While the term **""port scan""** typically refers to TCP/UDP probes on multiple ports, some detection systems generalize the term to include any kind of probing to see what is open or alive—including ICMP requests.
- If the detection system is configured to interpret **single or multiple ICMP Echo Requests as ""port scan""** attempts (since attackers sometimes use ICMP to find live hosts before scanning ports), this flow is classified as ""portScan"".
- Alternatively, it may be that the labeling system in your dataset does not have a more specific label for single ICMP Echo probes and thus assigns the general ""portScan"" label to any reconnaissance-type activity.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute      | Value                     | Interpretation           |
|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Proto          | ICMP                     | Not TCP/UDP              |
| Dest port      | 8.0                      | ICMP type 8 (Echo Req)   |
| Packets        | 1                        | Single probe             |
| Attack type    | portScan                 | Reconnaissance label     |

---

## **Summary:**
This network flow was classified as **""portScan""** because it is an **ICMP Echo Request (type 8, code 0)** from a source to a destination. Even though only a single packet was sent (not typical of a thorough port scan), some intrusion detection systems use the ""portScan"" label broadly for *any probing activity*—including ICMP Echo Requests—since attackers often use such probes to identify live hosts before conducting further scans or attacks. The lack of a more granular label (e.g., ""ICMP probe"" or ""pingScan"" for a single host) in your label set likely led to the use of ""portScan"" for this flow.

---

**If you have more context or other flows, the labeling scheme might be clearer, but for this single ICMP Echo Request, the ""portScan"" label is used as a general term for reconnaissance activity.**


Explanation: 7

Let's break down the network flow attributes and explain why this flow was classified as **""portScan""**:

---

### **Flow Details Recap**

- **Start time**: 2017-03-21 13:02:57.010  
- **Duration**: 0.0 seconds  
- **Protocol**: TCP  
- **Source IP**: 192.168.220.16  
- **Source Port**: 38148  
- **Destination IP**: 192.168.200.4  
- **Destination Port**: 1863  
- **Packets**: 1  
- **Bytes**: 58  
- **Flags**: ....S. (only the SYN flag is set)  

---

### **Analysis of the Flow**

#### 1. **Single SYN Packet**
- **Flags**: The flag is `....S.`, which means only the **SYN** flag is set. This is the flag used to initiate a TCP connection (the first step in the three-way handshake).
- **Packets**: Only **1** packet was sent, and it was a SYN.
- **Duration**: **0.0** seconds — the flow was extremely brief, almost instantaneous.

#### 2. **No Further Communication**
- There is no data exchange beyond the initial SYN packet — no ACK, no data, no further handshake steps.

#### 3. **Common Patterns in Port Scans**
- **Port scanning** is a technique attackers use to discover open or vulnerable ports on a target system. The most basic port scan is the **SYN scan** (also called ""half-open"" scan or ""stealth scan"").
- During a SYN scan, the attacker sends a SYN packet to a target port. If the port is open, the server responds with a SYN-ACK. The attacker may or may not complete the handshake.
- Each scan attempt typically:
  - Comes from a random or changing source port.
  - Targets a specific destination port on the target IP.
  - Involves only the SYN packet.
  - The flow is extremely short and often consists of only 1 packet.

#### 4. **Distinguishing from Other Attacks**
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Usually involves a high number of packets/bytes or repeated attempts to overwhelm a target, not just a single SYN packet.
- **Brute Force**: Involves multiple connection attempts to the same service, often with different credentials.
- **Ping Scan**: Uses ICMP, not TCP.
- **Normal Flow**: Would usually have a complete handshake and more than just a SYN packet.

---

### **Why This Flow is PortScan**

- **Single SYN packet** to a specific port, with no follow-up.  
- **No data transmitted** beyond the SYN.  
- **Duration of 0.0 seconds** — typical of a scan ""probing"" if the port is open.  
- **Pattern matches** a SYN scan, which is a classic port scan technique.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute | Value | PortScan Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| Packets   | 1     | Only 1 SYN sent, typical of a scan |
| Flags     | SYN   | SYN scan technique |
| Duration  | 0.0   | No real session, just probing |
| Protocol  | TCP   | SYN scans use TCP |
| Dest Port | 1863  | Could be part of a sequential scan of many ports |

---

## **Conclusion**

**The flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it consists of a single TCP SYN packet (no handshake or data), which is the classic signature of a port scanning tool probing a port to see if it is open. There is no evidence of an attack beyond reconnaissance, no service use, data transfer, or repeated attempts, further distinguishing it from other attack types.**


Explanation: 8

Let's analyze the flow attributes and why it would be classified as **""portScan""**:

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.100.6, **Source Port:** 14000
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16, **Destination Port:** 61477
- **Packets:** 1, **Bytes:** 54
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Flags:** `.A.R..` (ACK and RST)
- **Classification:** **portScan**

---

## Step-by-step Reasoning

### 1. **Single Packet, No Data Transfer**
- Only **1 packet** sent, with **54 bytes** (typical TCP header with no payload).
- **Duration** is 0.0, suggesting the flow was almost instantaneous.

### 2. **TCP Flags: `.A.R..`**
- The flags are: **ACK** and **RST**.
- This pattern is typical of a host responding to a connection attempt that it does not accept. For example:
    - If a SYN is sent to a closed port, the host responds with **RST,ACK**.

### 3. **Unusual Destination Port**
- **Destination port** is **61477**, a high-numbered, non-standard port.
- Attackers commonly scan uncommon ports to find open/available services.

### 4. **Behavior Consistent with Port Scanning**
- A port scan involves sending probes (usually SYN packets) to various ports to see which are open/closed.
- The typical response from a closed port is a **RST,ACK** packet.
- The recorded flow here is likely the **response** from the target to the scanning host (i.e., the scan's result).

### 5. **Why Not Other Attacks?**
- **DoS:** Usually involves many packets, larger flows, or repeated attempts. Here, only 1 packet.
- **BruteForce:** Implies repeated login attempts, often over standard service ports (SSH, FTP, etc.). Not the case here.
- **PingScan:** Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **Normal:** Normal connections involve more than 1 packet, data transfer, and different flag combinations.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute    | Value           | PortScan Relevance                                 |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Protocol     | TCP             | Port scanning often uses TCP                      |
| Packets      | 1               | Typical for scan probes (one probe, one response) |
| Flags        | .A.R..          | RST+ACK: closed port response to scan             |
| Duration     | 0.0             | Instantaneous, not a real session                 |
| Dest Port    | 61477           | High, non-standard port (scanners probe many)     |

---

## **Conclusion:**
**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**
- It consists of a single TCP packet with RST+ACK flags, which is a typical closed port response to a scan probe.
- The destination port is a random high port, often targeted during scanning.
- No actual data is transferred, and the connection is not established.
- The behavior is consistent with automated port scanning, not with legitimate application traffic or other attack types.

**In short:**  
> **A single TCP packet with RST+ACK flags, to a high-numbered port, with no data exchanged, is a strong indicator of a port scan probe and response.**

- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S. (**SYN flag set**, no other flags)

---

### **Key Observations**
1. **Single Packet, Single Byte Count:**  
   - Only 1 packet was sent (58 bytes), and the flow duration is 0.0 seconds. This indicates a very short interaction.

2. **TCP SYN Flag Only (....S.):**  
   - The only TCP flag set is SYN (Synchronize). This means this is likely the **start of a TCP connection attempt**. No ACK, PSH, RST, or FIN flags are set.

3. **No Ongoing Conversation:**  
   - No subsequent packets (no ACK in response, no data transfer, no completion of handshake).

---

### **Why ""portScan""?**

#### **Port Scanning Behavior**
- **Port Scanning** typically involves sending TCP SYN packets to various ports on a target host. The goal is to discover which ports are open by observing which ones respond with SYN-ACK (indicating open) versus RST (indicating closed).
- **A classic TCP port scan:**  
  - Sends a SYN packet to a port, waits for a response, and moves on.
- **In this flow:**  
  - The source IP sent a single TCP SYN packet to the destination IP and port 777.
  - There was no follow-up communication (no completion of the TCP handshake).
  - This is a signature of a port scan, where the attacker is probing ports to see if they are open, without actually establishing a connection.

#### **Why NOT other labels?**
- **dos:** Usually involves a high volume of packets or connections to exhaust resources; this is a single packet.
- **bruteForce:** Would involve multiple connection attempts with different credentials, not just single SYN packets.
- **pingScan:** Would involve ICMP echo requests, not TCP SYN packets.
- **--- (Normal):** Normal flows typically involve a proper handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and data transfer, not a lone SYN.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute             | PortScan Reasoning                  |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Packets: 1            | Only probing a port, not a session  |
| Flags: SYN only       | Attempt to initiate, not complete   |
| Duration: 0.0         | No ongoing connection               |
| Bytes: 58             | Just the SYN packet                 |
| No handshake/data     | Typical for scan, not normal use    |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow is classified as ""portScan"" because it exhibits the classic behavior of a port scan:**
- A single TCP SYN packet (no response, no handshake, no data),
- To a specific port,
- Without follow-up communication.

**This is a typical way attackers probe which ports are open, and thus it's flagged as a port scan.**

### **Network Flow Attributes Recap**

- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-15 06:14:26.425  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.200.3  
- **Src port:** 3827  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Dest port:** 51357  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 54  
- **Flags:** .A.R..  

---

### **Key Details in the Flow**

#### 1. **Single Packet, Short Duration**

- Only **1 packet** (lasting **0.0 seconds**), which is typical for scan-type activity rather than a sustained attack or normal communication.

#### 2. **TCP Flags: "".A.R.."" (ACK and RST set)**

- This means the flow consists of a packet with **ACK** and **RST** flags set.
- **RST (Reset)** packets are often used to abruptly terminate connections or indicate that a connection is not allowed.
- An **ACK+RST** packet is commonly seen in response to unsolicited incoming connections (such as a probe to a closed port).

#### 3. **High Destination Port**

- Destination port **51357** is a high, likely random, port — not associated with standard services.

#### 4. **Unusual Pattern for Legitimate Traffic**

- Legitimate TCP connections typically involve a **three-way handshake** (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), possibly followed by data transfer and a graceful finish (FIN).
- This flow, however, shows only a single packet with **RST+ACK**, suggesting an **immediate reset** (no real connection established).

---

### **Why This Indicates a Port Scan**

- **Port Scanning:** Attackers often scan a range of ports on a target system to discover which ports are open and what services are running.
- Typically, a scanner sends SYN packets to many ports. If a port is closed, the host responds with **RST**. If a port is open, the host responds with **SYN-ACK**.
- In some cases, the scanner may receive **RST+ACK** responses indicating a closed port.
- Single-packet flows with TCP RST or RST+ACK responses to high-numbered, non-standard ports are a hallmark of **port scanning activity**.

#### **Summary Table: Flow Patterns**

| Attack Type  | Typical Flow Pattern      | This Flow Matches?       |
|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Normal       | Multiple packets, data   | No                       |
| DoS          | Many packets, to same port/service | No        |
| BruteForce   | Repeated attempts on same service/port | No      |
| PingScan     | ICMP packets             | No (this is TCP)         |
| PortScan     | Single/small flows, random ports, RST/ACK flags | **Yes** |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**

- It involves a single TCP packet with RST+ACK flags (indicative of a port being probed and responding that it is closed).
- There is no established connection nor data transfer.
- The destination port is high and non-standard.
- This matches the signature of a host being scanned for open/closed ports by an external source.

**In summary:**  
**Single, short, TCP RST+ACK packet to a high port = classic port scan fingerprint.**


Explanation: 11

Let's break down the flow attributes and explain why **""portScan""** is the correct label:

---

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Date first seen**: 2017-03-15 14:17:14.344  
- **Duration**: 0.0  
- **Protocol**: TCP  
- **Src IP**: 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port**: 33168  
- **Dest IP**: 192.168.220.2  
- **Dest port**: 912  
- **Packets**: 1  
- **Bytes**: 58  
- **Flags**: ....S.  

---

### Analysis

#### 1. TCP Flags: `....S.`
- The **S** flag means **SYN**, which is the initial packet of a TCP handshake.
- The absence of other flags (no ACK, no RST, etc.) means this is just a SYN packet.

#### 2. Flow Duration and Packet Count
- **Duration: 0.0** — The flow was extremely brief, essentially just one packet.
- **Packets: 1** — Only a single packet was sent.

#### 3. Port Information
- The destination port is **912**—not a common port for well-known services.
- The source port is a high, likely ephemeral port.

#### 4. Behavior Summary
- This flow represents a **single SYN packet** sent from one host to another, targeting a particular port, with no response.

---

### Why is this port scanning?

**Port Scanning** is the act of sending packets to a range of ports on a host, often to determine which ports are open. The most common method is to send SYN packets (like the first step of a TCP handshake) to various ports and observe which ones respond.

#### Key Indicators in this Flow:
1. **Single SYN Packet**  
   The host (192.168.220.16) sent only a SYN packet to a port. No follow-up packets, no data transmission—just an attempt to initiate a connection.

2. **Uncommon Port**  
   The destination port (912) is not typical for regular user or server traffic. Attackers often scan less common ports to discover hidden services.

3. **No Response/Short Duration**  
   No handshake completion, no data transfer—just probing if the port is open.

4. **Pattern Consistent with Port Scanning**  
   In flow-based detection, a series of similar flows (single SYN packet, different destination ports, short duration) from the same source IP is a classic signature of a port scan. Even individually, such flows are suspicious when seen in context.

---

### Why Not the Other Labels?

- **""---"" (No attack)**: Normal flows involve more than just a single SYN packet, usually with a handshake and some data transfer.
- **""dos"" (Denial of Service)**: DOS attacks involve high packet rates, often to the same port, and usually more than just a single SYN packet.
- **""bruteForce""**: Brute force attacks involve repeated login attempts, requiring full handshakes and data exchange.
- **""pingScan""**: Involves ICMP packets (not TCP).

---

## **Summary**

**This flow was labeled ""portScan"" because it consists of a single TCP SYN packet directed at an uncommon port, with no further traffic, which matches the typical pattern of a port scanning activity. Port scans are reconnaissance steps to discover open ports on a host, commonly performed by sending SYN packets and observing responses.**

If you saw many such flows from the same source IP to multiple destination ports, it would be a clear signature of a port scan. Even a single such flow can be flagged as suspicious in many detection systems.


Explanation: 12

Let's analyze the flow attributes and why it was classified as **""portScan""**:

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Proto**: TCP  
- **Src IP / Port**: 192.168.200.4:2001
- **Dest IP / Port**: 192.168.220.16:51357
- **Packets**: 1
- **Bytes**: 54
- **Flags**: .A.R.. (ACK and RST set)
- **Duration**: 0.0 seconds

---

## Why is this a **Port Scan**?

### 1. **Single Packet, Short Duration**
- Only **one packet** was sent and the **duration is zero**. This suggests a probe, not a normal connection.

### 2. **TCP Flags: .A.R.. (ACK and RST set)**
- The flow consisted of a TCP packet with both **ACK** and **RST** flags set.
  - This is uncommon in normal connections, but typical in scanning/host discovery.
- **RST (Reset)** is commonly used in scanning to close connections or as a response to unexpected packets.

### 3. **No Data Transfer**
- Only 54 bytes were sent (just a single TCP header, likely no payload).

### 4. **Unusual Destination Port**
- The destination port (51357) is a high, likely random port.
- Scanners often probe many ports, including high-numbered ones, to find open services.

### 5. **Behavior Consistent with Port Scanning**
- In a **TCP port scan**, a scanner sends packets to various ports and observes the responses to determine which ports are open.
- **ACK** or **RST** flags are sometimes used to:
    - Bypass simple firewalls (which may only block SYN packets).
    - Elicit a response from the target host.
- The presence of only an **ACK+RST** packet and no established session is a classic indicator of a scan, not normal communication.

### 6. **Not a DoS, BruteForce, or PingScan**
- **DoS:** Would involve many packets and longer duration.
- **BruteForce:** Involves multiple login attempts, not just single packets.
- **PingScan:** Would use ICMP, not TCP.

---

## **Summary Reason**
This flow was classified as **""portScan""** because:
- It is a very short-lived TCP flow (single packet, zero duration).
- The packet used flags (ACK, RST) that are typical for scanning/probing, not for establishing connections.
- The destination port is high and likely random, as in a scan.
- There is no evidence of data transfer or login attempts.
- The behavior matches known port scanning techniques.

---

**In short:**  
> It matches the pattern of a TCP ACK/RST port scan, where an attacker sends single TCP packets to various ports to determine which ports are open or how the target responds, without attempting to establish a real connection.


Explanation: 13

Let's analyze your network flow and **why it was classified as a ""portScan""**.

### Flow Details

- **Timestamp:** 2017-03-17 13:57:07.317
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds (very short/instantaneous)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.100.2
- **Source Port:** 49
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Destination Port:** 61477
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 54
- **TCP Flags:** `.A.R..` (ACK and RST set, others not set)

---

## Flow Analysis

1. **Single Packet, Very Short Duration:**
   - Only **one packet**.
   - **Duration is 0.0** (i.e., no real ""conversation"", only a single interaction).
   
2. **High Destination Port:**
   - Destination port is **61477**, a high, likely random port—not a typical service port.

3. **TCP Flags:**
   - **.A.R..** means **ACK** and **RST** flags are set.
   - This flag combination is often seen in **responses** to unsolicited or unexpected connection attempts, or when a host is probing for open ports.
   - If a host receives a SYN-ACK or a SYN to a port where nothing is listening, it may respond with RST.

4. **No Data Transfer:**
   - Only 54 bytes (the minimum size for a TCP packet with headers, no payload).

---

## Why ""portScan""?

A **port scan** is when an attacker (or scanning tool) sends connection attempts to a range of different ports (often high-numbered, non-standard ports) to see which ones are open and accepting connections.

### This flow matches ""portScan"" because:

- **Single, unsolicited TCP probe**: Only one packet, short-lived, to a high-numbered port. This is typical of a scan, not a normal connection or data exchange.
- **Flag pattern**: An RST with ACK is a common response to a probe sent to a closed port.
- **No follow-up traffic**: Just one packet—no back-and-forth data exchange, which is typical for scans.
- **Non-standard port**: The destination port is not a common service port, suggesting a scan rather than legitimate use.
- **Not a DoS, brute force, or ping scan**: 
  - DoS involves many packets or high traffic.
  - Brute force involves repeated login attempts.
  - Ping scan uses ICMP, not TCP.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute     | Value            | Typical for PortScan? |
|---------------|------------------|:--------------------:|
| Packets       | 1                | ✔️                    |
| Duration      | 0.0              | ✔️                    |
| Dest Port     | 61477            | ✔️                    |
| Flags         | .A.R..           | ✔️                    |
| Protocol      | TCP              | ✔️                    |
| Traffic Volume| 54 bytes         | ✔️                    |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it matches the typical pattern of a single, short-lived probe to a high-numbered port, with no follow-up traffic, and the TCP flags suggest a scan rather than a legitimate connection.**

If you saw many such flows from the same source to different destination ports, it would very clearly indicate a port scanning activity. Even a single such flow, in this context, is suspicious enough to warrant classification as ""portScan"".


Explanation: 14

Let's analyze the provided network flow and **why it was classified as ""portScan""**.

### **Network Flow Attributes**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-16 15:40:12.607
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Protocol:** ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source port:** 0
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.100.104
- **Destination port:** 8.0
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 42
- **Flags:** ......

---

## **Detailed Analysis**

### **1. Protocol: ICMP**
- ICMP is commonly used for diagnostic or control purposes (e.g., the `ping` command).
- **It does not use ports** in the traditional sense (unlike TCP/UDP), but ICMP packets do have ""types"" and ""codes."" Here, ""Dest port: 8.0"" likely refers to **ICMP Type 8 (Echo Request)**, which is used by `ping` utilities.

### **2. ICMP Type 8 (Echo Request)**
- **ICMP Echo Request (Type 8)** is used to check if a host is alive (i.e., responds to ICMP requests).

### **3. Number of Packets/Bytes**
- Only **1 packet** was sent, totaling **42 bytes**.

### **4. Flags**
- Flags are not applicable for ICMP, so they're all dots.

---

## **Attack Type Labels**
- **No attack:** Normal flow
- **dos:** Denial of Service (DoS)
- **portScan:** Scans for open/active ports
- **bruteForce:** Attempts to guess credentials
- **pingScan:** Uses ICMP Echo Requests to discover hosts

---

## **Why ""portScan""?**

### **Normally, ICMP Echo Requests are associated with ""pingScan,""** not ""portScan."" Port scanning typically involves:
- Sending packets to a range of ports on a target to identify which ports are open (e.g., using TCP SYN packets to various ports).
- ICMP is used for host discovery, not for port scanning.

### **However, why might this be labeled as ""portScan""?**

1. **Labeling Error or Dataset Convention**
   - The dataset or labeling process may not distinguish between ICMP-based scans (pingScan) and port scans, lumping all scan-like activity as ""portScan.""

2. **ICMP Used for Port Unreachable**
   - Some port scan techniques (e.g., UDP scans) rely on **ICMP Port Unreachable** messages as a response to determine if a port is closed. But that is not the case here: this is a direct Echo Request.

3. **Misinterpretation of Attributes**
   - The system may have interpreted the ""Destination port: 8.0"" as an indication of a scan targeting a specific port, even though this is ICMP (Type 8), not a TCP/UDP port.
   - If multiple similar flows exist (i.e., one ICMP Echo Request to each host in the subnet), this could be seen as a scan.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute          | Value         | Typical for PortScan? |
|--------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| Protocol           | ICMP         | Not typical           |
| Dest Port          | 8.0 (ICMP 8) | Not a port            |
| Packets            | 1            | Often many            |
| Bytes              | 42           | Small                 |
| Type of Scan       | Ping Scan    | Not port scan         |

---

## **Conclusion:**

### **The most likely reason this flow was labeled as ""portScan"" is:**
- The labeling system in use **does not properly differentiate between port scans and host discovery scans (ping scans) using ICMP**. It likely considers any scan-like activity, including ICMP Echo Requests, as a ""portScan.""
- Alternatively, if the flow is part of a larger set of flows where the source sends ICMP Echo Requests to many hosts/addresses, the system may interpret this as reconnaissance activity similar to port scanning.

---

### **In Short:**
> **This flow was labeled ""portScan"" because the system interpreted the ICMP Echo Request (type 8) as a scanning action, possibly due to labeling conventions that do not distinguish between port scans (which target ports) and ping scans (which use ICMP). In reality, this flow is more typical of a ping scan, not a port scan.**

If you have more flows (e.g., many similar ICMP requests to different IPs or ports), the classification could make more sense. But for a single ICMP Echo Request, the more accurate label would be ""pingScan.""


Explanation: 15

Let's analyze **why this network flow was classified as ""portScan""** based on the attributes you provided.

### Flow Details

| Attribute    | Value                |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Start time   | 2017-03-17 13:45:27.811 |
| Duration     | 0.0                  |
| Protocol     | TCP                  |
| Src IP       | 192.168.100.6        |
| Src port     | 587                  |
| Dest IP      | 192.168.220.16       |
| Dest port    | 61508                |
| Packets      | 1                    |
| Bytes        | 54                   |
| TCP Flags    | .A.R..               |

### Key Observations

1. **Single Packet, Zero Duration:**  
   - Only **one packet** was sent.
   - **Duration is 0.0 seconds**, indicating no ongoing session.

2. **TCP Flags: `.A.R..`**  
   - The flags are **ACK** and **RST** (Reset).
   - This flag combination typically occurs when a host **rejects a connection attempt**.

3. **Source and Destination Ports:**  
   - Source port is 587 (commonly used for SMTP submission, but this is likely random here).
   - Destination port is **61508**, which is a **high/ephemeral port**.

4. **No Data Transfer:**  
   - Only 54 bytes transferred, which is the typical size of a single TCP packet with no data (just headers).

### Why is this a ""portScan""?

- **Port scan** attacks are characterized by a host rapidly sending packets to a range of ports on another host, attempting to discover open/exposed services.
- The flow you provided fits **port scanning behavior** due to:
  - A **single probe** to an unusual, high-numbered port (61508).
  - The connection does **not establish a session** (only one packet, zero duration), which is typical for a scan.
  - The presence of **RST (Reset) and ACK flags** in the response means the destination host received a connection attempt to a port where **no service is listening**, and so it replied with RST (a normal response to a closed port).
  - **No further packets** exchanged, suggesting the scanner just tried the port and moved on.

#### Additional Context

- In a **DoS attack**, you'd expect many packets or repeated attempts.
- In **brute force**, you'd see multiple packets trying to authenticate.
- In **ping scan**, you would see ICMP, not TCP.
- **Normal traffic** would usually involve a handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and some data transfer.

### **Summary Explanation**

This flow is classified as **""portScan""** because it exhibits the classic signature of a port scan: a single TCP connection attempt to a high-numbered port, which is immediately reset by the destination (via a RST+ACK packet), with no further communication. This behavior strongly indicates an attempt to probe for open ports rather than establish a legitimate connection.

---

**In short:**  
> *The flow was labeled as ""portScan"" because it consists of a single TCP packet to a non-standard port, receiving a reset response, with no data transfer or session established, which matches the typical behavior of a port scanning attempt.*


Explanation: 16

Let's break down the key attributes of your network flow:

- **Start time:** 2017-03-21 00:26:04.391  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 33508  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.210.1  
- **Dest port:** 16000  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S. (**SYN flag set**)

### Why was this flow classified as ""portScan""?

#### 1. **Single SYN Packet**
The only TCP flag set is **SYN** (`....S.`), which means this packet is trying to initiate a new TCP connection (the first step in a standard TCP handshake).

#### 2. **No Further Communication**
- **Packets:** Only 1 packet was sent.
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds (flow was almost instantaneous).
- **Bytes:** Only 58 bytes transmitted (just the SYN packet).

This means no reply (like SYN-ACK or ACK) was observed, and no data was exchanged.

#### 3. **Behavior Consistent with Port Scanning**
A **Port Scan** attack typically works by sending SYN packets (or sometimes other probing packets) to a range of ports on a target system to discover which ports are open and accepting connections. This is usually done by:

- Sending a SYN packet to a port.
- Waiting for a response (SYN-ACK if the port is open, RST if not).
- Not completing the handshake, just moving to the next port (sometimes called a ""half-open scan"" or ""SYN scan"").

Your flow matches this pattern:
- A SYN packet was sent from one IP/port to a destination port.
- No further packets or handshake occurred.

#### 4. **No Evidence of Other Attack Types**
- **DoS:** This is a single packet, not enough to overwhelm a service.
- **BruteForce:** No multiple login attempts or repeated connections.
- **PingScan:** This is a TCP SYN, not an ICMP Echo (ping).
- **No Attack:** The behavior is more typical of reconnaissance (scanning) than normal user/application activity.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | Value             | Indicative of PortScan? |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| TCP Flag          | SYN only         | Yes                    |
| Packets           | 1                | Yes                    |
| Bytes             | 58               | Yes                    |
| Duration          | 0.0              | Yes                    |
| Data Transfer     | None             | Yes                    |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as a ""portScan"" because it consists of a single TCP SYN packet (typical of port scanning behavior) with no follow-up communication, which is characteristic of a scan to detect open ports, rather than a normal connection or other type of attack.**

If you have further questions about this classification or want to see how multiple flows could more clearly indicate a port scan, let me know!


Explanation: 17

Let’s break down the flow’s characteristics and **why it is classified as a ""portScan""**:

### 1. **Only 1 Packet and 0.0 Duration**
- The flow lasted for essentially **zero time** and involved only **one packet**.
- This is typical for a scan, where a connection attempt is made, but no actual data is exchanged.

### 2. **TCP Protocol with SYN Flag Only (....S.)**
- The **Flags** field is `....S.`, meaning **only the SYN flag is set**.
  - In TCP, the SYN flag is used to initiate a connection.
  - When only a SYN is sent (without any follow-up ACK or data), it often indicates a **probe to check if a port is open**.
- Scanners or attackers send SYN packets to a range of ports to discover which are open, without completing the handshake.

### 3. **Unusual Destination Port**
- Destination port is **10243.0**, which is not a common service port. Scanners often target a range of ports, including uncommon or high-numbered ports, to find open services.

### 4. **Very Small Amount of Data**
- Only **58 bytes** were transmitted, which is roughly the size of a single TCP SYN packet.

### 5. **No Follow-up Communication**
- There is no evidence of a response or further packets (no ACK, no data transfer).  
- In a normal connection, you’d expect a SYN-ACK reply and more packets exchanged.

---

## **Why Not Other Attack Types?**

- **DoS:** Would involve many packets or a flood of requests, not just a single SYN.
- **BruteForce:** Would show repeated attempts to log in, usually with more packets and data.
- **PingScan:** Would be ICMP protocol, not TCP.
- **Normal flow:** Would have a completed handshake and data transfer.

## **Conclusion**

**This flow is classified as ""portScan"" because it consists of a single TCP SYN packet sent to an uncommon port, with no further data exchange or connection establishment. This is the classic signature of a port scan, where the goal is to discover open ports and services, not to establish a real communication or carry out a denial of service.**


Explanation: 18

Certainly! Let's break down the flow's attributes and why it was classified as a **""portScan""**:

---

### 1. **Key Flow Details**

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-16 13:46:41.768  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source Port:** 47082  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.210.5  
- **Destination Port:** 6389  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **TCP Flags:** ....S. (SYN only)

---

### 2. **What the Flow Shows**

- **Single Packet:** Only 1 packet was sent, which is very typical of a scan.
- **SYN Flag Only:** The TCP flags show only a SYN set (""....S.""), meaning this packet is a connection attempt but doesn't complete the handshake (no ACK/FIN/RST/PSH/URG). This is the first step of a TCP handshake.
- **Random or High Destination Port:** Port 6389 is not a common service port, which may indicate scanning for open or vulnerable services.
- **No Duration:** Duration of 0.0 seconds also supports the idea that there was no established connection—just a probe.

---

### 3. **Why is this Characteristic of a Port Scan?**

A **port scan** is a technique used by attackers (or network admins) to discover which ports on a target host are open and listening for connections. The most common type is the **TCP SYN scan (also called half-open scan)**, where:

- The scanner sends a SYN packet to the target port.
- If the port is open, the target replies with SYN-ACK.
- The scanner can then drop the connection (often by not responding further or sending a RST), thus leaving no completed handshake.

**Indicators of a Port Scan in your flow:**

- **SYN-Only Traffic:** Only SYN flag is set, no further communication (no data, no session).
- **Unusual Port:** Port being probed is not a standard port (e.g., not 80, 443, etc.).
- **Single Probe:** Only one packet sent—common in scanning, not in real connections.
- **No Data Transfer:** Only 58 bytes, which matches the size of a single TCP SYN packet.
- **No Duration:** Suggests no ongoing communication.

---

### 4. **Why Not Other Labels?**

- **""---"" (Normal):** Normal flows usually show a completed handshake and data exchange, not just a single SYN.
- **""dos"":** Denial of service involves many packets, often to overload the target.
- **""bruteForce"":** Brute force attacks involve repeated attempts to guess credentials, usually with multiple packets and completed handshakes.
- **""pingScan"":** Ping scans use ICMP, not TCP SYN.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute      | Value              | PortScan Explanation                                 |
|----------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Packets        | 1                  | Single SYN probe typical of scanning                 |
| Bytes          | 58                 | Just a SYN packet, no data                           |
| Flags          | ....S.             | SYN only = initial connection attempt                |
| Duration       | 0.0                | No connection established                            |
| Dest Port      | 6389               | Non-standard port, commonly probed during scans      |

---

## **Conclusion**
This flow was labeled **""portScan""** because it shows the classic signature of a TCP SYN scan:
- A single SYN-only packet sent to an uncommon port, with no further communication.

**This is a widely recognized technique for discovering open ports/services on a target machine.**

If you have more flows or need to compare other types, feel free to ask!


Explanation: 19

Let's break down the flow attributes and the likely reasoning behind the ""portScan"" label:

---

**Flow Attributes:**

- **Start time:** 2017-03-17 15:47:50.432
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP/Port:** 192.168.220.16:33535
- **Destination IP/Port:** 192.168.210.4:5060
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 58
- **Flags:** ....S. (Only the SYN flag is set)

---

### Why is this ""portScan""?

1. **Single Packet, SYN Only:**
   - The flow consists of **only one packet**.
   - The packet has the **SYN flag set** (....S.), indicating the start of a TCP connection (the ""handshake"" initiation). No ACK, no PSH, no FIN, no RST.
   - This is typical of a host trying to see if a port is open, but not actually completing a connection.

2. **Very Short Duration:**
   - The flow duration is 0.0 seconds, meaning there was no meaningful communication—just a single attempt.

3. **No Response or Follow-Up:**
   - No further packets were exchanged, suggesting the initiator wasn't interested in communication, just in testing/identifying the port status.

4. **Targeting a Specific Port:**
   - The **destination port is 5060**, commonly used by SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) for VoIP services—a frequent target in scans.

5. **Port Scanning Behavior:**
   - Port scanning often involves sending SYN packets to multiple ports (or hosts), waiting for a response (SYN-ACK or RST), and then moving on.
   - Attackers (or scanners) generally do **not** complete the handshake (they don’t send an ACK after SYN-ACK), which would result in a longer flow with more packets.

---

### Why **not** the other labels?

- **""---"" (Normal flow):**  
  Normal flows typically involve a completed handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and some data exchange, not just a lone SYN.
- **""dos"":**  
  Denial of service attacks usually involve a large number of packets or flows, often with higher traffic volume and/or repeated attempts.
- **""bruteForce"":**  
  Brute force attacks show repeated login attempts or protocol-specific activity, not just SYN packets.
- **""pingScan"":**  
  Would use ICMP Echo Request, not TCP SYN packets.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | Observation                                 | Suggests      |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Packets           | 1                                           | Scan/probe    |
| Flags             | SYN only                                    | Port scan     |
| Duration          | 0.0                                         | No handshake  |
| Bytes             | 58 (typical for TCP SYN)                    | Probe         |
| Protocol          | TCP                                         | Not ping scan |
| Dest port         | 5060 (SIP, often scanned)                   | Port scan     |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it matches the typical pattern of a TCP SYN scan: a single SYN packet from one host to a specific port on another host, with no completion of the handshake or data transfer. This is the classic approach for discovering open ports on a target system.**


Explanation: 20

Let's break down the flow attributes and why it makes sense for it to be classified as **""portScan""**:

#### Flow Attributes:
- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-16 16:08:21.487  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.100.2  
- **Source port:** 1192  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Destination port:** 53392  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 54  
- **Flags:** `.A.R..` (ACK and RST set)

---

## Why ""portScan""?

### 1. **Single Packet, Zero Duration**
- **Packets:** Only 1 packet was sent.
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds (essentially instantaneous).
This usually suggests a probe or test, not a sustained communication.

### 2. **Unusual TCP Flags: `.A.R..`**
- **Flags:** Only **ACK** and **RST** are set.
- Normally, a TCP connection starts with a SYN packet, and a normal session would have a series of SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, etc.
- The presence of **RST (Reset)** means the connection was immediately reset—often the sign of a probe or a response to an unexpected or unwanted connection.
- **ACK + RST** is commonly used as a response to a port scan (for example, when a port is closed and the host wants to indicate “connection refused”).

### 3. **High Destination Port**
- **Destination port:** 53392 is a high, likely unused or ephemeral port.
- Port scans frequently target a range of ports, including high-numbered ones, to see which ones are open.

### 4. **Behavioral Pattern**
- In a **port scan**, an attacker sends probe packets to various ports on a target machine to discover which ports are open and accepting connections.
- The classic scan sends a SYN or sometimes a NULL or other unusual flag combination; upon getting a response (SYN-ACK, RST, etc.), the scanner records whether the port is open, closed, or filtered.
- The fact that this flow consists of a single TCP packet, immediately reset, with no data transferred, is **characteristic of a scan** (the attacker is not trying to establish a real connection, just probing).

### 5. **Not DOS, Brute Force, or Ping Scan**
- **DoS** or **Brute Force** would involve multiple packets, longer durations, or repetitive attempts.
- **Ping Scan** would use ICMP, not TCP.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Feature      | Value           | Typical for PortScan? | Explanation                          |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Packets      | 1               | Yes                  | Single probe                         |
| Duration     | 0.0             | Yes                  | Instant probe                        |
| Flags        | `.A.R..`        | Yes                  | ACK+RST indicates scan/probe attempt |
| Dest Port    | 53392           | Yes                  | High port, often probed in scans     |
| Protocol     | TCP             | Yes                  | Most port scans use TCP              |

---

## **Conclusion**

This flow was classified as **""portScan""** because it matches the classic signature of a TCP port scan:  
- Single packet  
- Zero duration  
- Use of high-numbered port  
- TCP RST+ACK flags  
- No real connection or data

**In short:**  
> The flow looks like a probe to check if a specific TCP port is open, which is the hallmark of a port scanning attack.

Explanation: 21

Let's analyze the flow and the classification as **""portScan""** step by step:

### Flow Summary

| Attribute        | Value                   |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Start Time       | 2017-03-17 15:53:15.054|

| Flags            | .A.R..                 |

---

### Key Points for Port Scan Detection

#### 1. **Single Packet, Short Duration**
- The flow consists of only **one packet** and a duration of **0.0** seconds, suggesting no real ongoing communication.

#### 2. **TCP Flags: `.A.R..`**
- The flags set here are **ACK** and **RST**.
    - **ACK (Acknowledgment)**: Used to acknowledge receipt of data.
    - **RST (Reset)**: Used to abruptly terminate a connection or indicate that a connection does not exist.
- A flow with only ACK and RST and **no SYN** is unusual for normal connection establishment.
    - Often, when a host scans a port, it may send packets that elicit responses to determine if a port is open or closed.
    - Receiving an **RST/ACK** is typical when probing a **closed port**.

#### 3. **High Destination Port**
- The destination port is **33535**, which is a high (non-standard) port.
    - Port scans frequently target a wide range of ports, including high, less common ports, to identify services running on non-standard ports.

#### 4. **Normal vs. Attack Behavior**
- **Normal traffic** usually involves multiple packets and established connections (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, etc.).
- **Port scans** typically generate a large number of short, failed connection attempts (often resulting in RST responses).

#### 5. **Contextual Clues (not present in this single flow, but typically used)**
- If many similar flows are observed from the same source to different destination ports, it is a strong indicator of a port scan.
- Even with a single flow, certain patterns (like this flag combination and packet count) are typical of port scan responses.

---

### **Why This Flow is Classified as ""portScan""**

- The flow represents a **single TCP packet** with **ACK** and **RST** flags, targeting a **non-standard port** (33535).
- The **lack of a SYN flag** and a **single packet** suggest this is not a legitimate connection attempt, but rather a probe.
- **Port scans** often result in servers responding with RST/ACK when the probed port is closed.
- This pattern matches the **expected behavior of a port scan attack**, where the attacker is scanning ports to find open or closed ones by provoking RST/ACK responses.

---

## **Summary**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**
- It consists of a single TCP packet with ACK and RST flags (no data transfer, no real connection).
- It targets a high, non-standard port.
- This is a typical result of scanning for open ports, where closed ports reply with RST/ACK.
- Such a pattern is characteristic of port scanning activity rather than normal user traffic.

If you have further flows or more context, the classification would be even clearer, but even with a single flow, these indicators are strong enough.


Explanation: 22

Let's break down the attributes of your network flow and understand **why it was classified as ""portScan""** instead of another label.

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Start time:** 2017-03-17 13:30:49.430  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 61477  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.100.1  
- **Dest port:** 2190.0  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S. (**SYN** flag only)

---

## Key Points for Classification

### 1. **TCP SYN Packet (Flags: ....S.)**
- The only flag set is SYN.  
- This means it is the **first step of a TCP handshake**; the source is trying to initiate a new connection but hasn't received a response.

### 2. **Single Packet, Single Byte Count**
- Only **one packet** was sent, for **58 bytes**.  
- This is typical for a SYN packet (small, no data payload).

### 3. **Extremely Short Duration**
- Duration is **0.0**; the flow started and ended almost instantly.

### 4. **No Data Transmission**
- Only a connection attempt, no actual data was exchanged.

---

## Why is this **""portScan""** and not another attack or benign?

### **What is a Port Scan?**
- A **port scan** is when an attacker sends connection attempts (e.g., SYN packets) to many ports on a target machine to discover which ones are open.
- Typical signature: **many SYN packets** from a source to one or more destination IPs, each to a different port, without completing the handshake.

### **Why Not Other Labels?**

- **Normal (""---""):**  
  - Normal flows usually involve completed handshakes, or at least some data exchanged, not just a single SYN with no reply.

- **DoS:**  
  - Denial of Service typically involves **large numbers of packets** to a single or few ports to overwhelm the service—not a single SYN.

- **BruteForce:**  
  - Brute force attacks involve repeated login attempts (usually many packets, often to a specific service/port), not just a single SYN.

- **PingScan:**  
  - Ping scan uses ICMP echo requests (not TCP SYN packets) to see which hosts are up.

---

## **Summary: Why ""portScan""?**

- This flow **matches the classic signature of a port scan**:  
  - A SYN packet, with no further communication, targeting a specific port, likely as part of a sweep to see if the port is open.
- Network flow-based IDS systems often label **""single SYN packet, no follow-up""** as a port scan, especially if it is part of a pattern (many such flows from the same source to different destination ports).
- Even if you only see one such flow, the presence of a single, unsolicited SYN packet with no handshake completion is **suspicious** and typical of a port scan attempt.

---

## **Final Explanation**

> **The flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it consists of a single TCP SYN packet (with no data exchange or handshake completion) from a source IP to a specific destination port. This pattern matches the behavior of port scanning, where an attacker sends SYN packets to various ports to discover which ones are open, rather than attempting to establish a full connection or transmit data.**

If you have a dataset, you'd likely see many such flows from the same source to different ports, further confirming the port scan behavior.


Explanation: 23

Let's analyze the provided network flow and the reasoning behind its classification as **""portScan""**.

---

### Provided Flow Details

- **Start time**: 2017-03-20 09:04:33.158  
- **Duration**: 0.0  
- **Protocol**: TCP  
- **Source IP / Port**: 192.168.220.1 : 808  
- **Destination IP / Port**: 192.168.220.16 : 41422  
- **Packets**: 1  
- **Bytes**: 54  
- **TCP Flags**: `.A.R..` (ACK, RST)

---

## Key Observations

1. **Duration is 0.0 seconds**
   - This suggests an extremely brief exchange, often a single packet or two.

2. **Number of Packets: 1**
   - Only a single packet was involved, which is typical for quick probes or scans.

3. **TCP Flags: `.A.R..`**
   - The flags set are **ACK** (Acknowledgment) and **RST** (Reset).
   - This commonly occurs when a host receives a packet it does not expect (for example, a SYN-ACK without a SYN, or a connection to a closed port).

4. **Source and Destination Ports**
   - Source port is a common alternate port (808), and the destination port is a high, seemingly random port (41422).
   - High, incrementing, or random destination ports are a hallmark of port scans.

5. **No Data Exchange**
   - Just 54 bytes (typical for a minimal TCP header), no payload.

---

## Why ""portScan""?

A **port scan** is an activity where an attacker (or network tool) probes multiple ports on a host to discover which services are available (open ports). Typical signatures include:

- **Connection attempts to many ports** (often high or non-standard numbers).
- **Minimal interaction**: only the initial packets, no actual data transfer.
- **Immediate reset or no response** if the port is closed.

### In your flow:

- The connection attempt was made to an unusual, high-numbered port (41422).
- The server immediately responded with an **ACK+RST**, indicating the port was closed and the connection was rejected.
- Only a single packet was observed, and the entire interaction lasted 0 seconds.
- Such behavior is typical for a port scan:  
  - The scanning host sends a **SYN** to the target port.
  - If the port is closed, the target responds with **RST** (sometimes with ACK, depending on the system).
  - The scanner then moves on to the next port, without further interaction.

### Why not another label?

- **No attack (---)**: If this were a normal flow, you would expect more packets and some data exchange.
- **DoS**: A denial of service attack typically involves many packets or sustained traffic, not a single probe.
- **BruteForce**: Would show repeated attempts to the same service/port, not a single probe.
- **PingScan**: Would use ICMP, not TCP.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Flow Behavior         | PortScan | This Flow |
|----------------------|:--------:|:---------:|
| High/random ports    |   Yes    |   Yes     |
| Single/few packets   |   Yes    |   Yes     |
| No data transfer     |   Yes    |   Yes     |
| Immediate RST/ACK    |   Yes    |   Yes     |
| Short duration       |   Yes    |   Yes     |

**All align with a port scan.**

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**
- It consists of a single TCP connection attempt to a high, likely random port.
- The connection was immediately reset (ACK+RST), typical of a closed port response.
- No data was exchanged and the interaction was extremely brief.
- This pattern is the classic signature of a port scan, where an attacker rapidly probes for open ports on a target system.


Explanation: 24

Let's break down the network flow attributes and the reasoning behind its classification as **""portScan""**:

---

### **Network Flow Attributes Recap**

- **Start time:** 2017-03-21 13:05:34.957  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.200.2  
- **Src port:** 340  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Dest port:** 38148  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 54  
- **Flags:** `.A.R..` (ACK and RST)

---

## **Key Observations**

### 1. **Single Packet, Very Short Duration**
- Only **1 packet** was sent and the **duration is 0.0 seconds**. This is typical of scanning activity, where the attacker is not interested in actually establishing a connection but just wants to probe the port.

### 2. **TCP Flags: `.A.R..` (ACK and RST)**
- The flow includes the **ACK** (A) and **RST** (R) flags.
    - **RST** (Reset) is sent to abort a connection attempt.
    - **ACK** (Acknowledgement) is often seen in responses.
- This flag combination is typical when a host is probing closed ports and receives a reset as a reply, or when sending crafted packets to elicit a response for scanning purposes.

### 3. **Unusual Destination Port**
- The **destination port is 38148**, which is not a common service port (like 80, 443, 22, etc.). Scanners often check non-standard ports to see if anything is running.

### 4. **Low Number of Bytes**
- Only **54 bytes** transferred — indicative of a single, small TCP packet (likely just a header).

---

## **Why is this indicative of a port scan?**

- **Port scans** are reconnaissance activities where an attacker sends packets to various ports of a target to determine which services are open.
- In a **TCP port scan**, the most common methods are:
    - **SYN scan**: Send SYN packets, look for SYN-ACK or RST responses.
    - **ACK scan**: Send ACK packets to see if a firewall is stateful.
    - **NULL, FIN, or XMAS scans**: Use unusual flag combinations to probe for open or closed ports.

- In this flow:
    - A single packet is sent to a high port.
    - The use of ACK and RST flags is typical of scanning techniques (like ACK scans or receiving RST-ACK in response to a probe).
    - There's no actual conversation/connection, just a probe.

---

## **Why NOT other attack types?**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Usually involves multiple packets, higher traffic volume, and repeated attempts.
- **Brute Force:** Multiple connection attempts to the same service/port, usually with login attempts.
- **Ping Scan:** Uses ICMP protocol, not TCP.
- **Normal (""---""):** Normal flows typically involve multiple packets, bidirectional traffic, and standard flag sequences (e.g., SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | PortScan Typical? | This Flow |
|-------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Single packet     | Yes              | Yes       |
| Short duration    | Yes              | Yes       |
| Unusual port      | Yes              | Yes       |
| TCP flags (RST/ACK)| Yes             | Yes       |
| Low bytes         | Yes              | Yes       |

---

## **Conclusion**

This flow was classified as **""portScan""** because it matches the typical characteristics of a TCP port scan: a single, small packet with specific TCP flags (ACK, RST) sent to a non-standard port, with no real connection established. Such traffic is commonly generated by port scanning tools or scripts to map which ports are open or closed on a target system.

Explanation: 25

Let’s analyze the network flow and explain why it was classified as **""portScan""**:

### **Flow Details**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-15 14:21:01.077  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source port:** 33168  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.2  
- **Destination port:** 1271 (Note: 1271.0 seems to be a typo; likely 1271)  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S. (Only SYN flag is set)  

---

### **Key Observations**
1. **Only 1 packet, SYN flag set:**
   - The only TCP flag present is SYN. This means the packet is trying to **initiate a connection** (it's a connection request).
   - There are no subsequent packets (no ACK, no response, no established session).

2. **No Data Transfer, Zero Duration:**
   - **Duration is 0.0**, only 1 packet sent, and only 58 bytes (typical size for a TCP SYN packet).
   - There's **no actual data exchange** or session establishment.

3. **Port Number:**
   - The destination port is **1271**.  
   - This is **not a common service port** (like 80, 443, 22, etc.), suggesting the connection is probing unusual or non-standard ports.

---

### **Why Is This Port Scanning?**

**Port scanning** is a technique used by attackers to **probe a host for open ports** by sending connection requests (often SYN packets) to a range of ports. The scanner then observes which ports respond, indicating which services may be running.

- **This flow shows a SYN packet to an uncommon port (1271), with no follow-up packets.**
- Often, in a port scan, the attacker sends SYN packets to many different ports, one after another, without completing the handshake (no ACK or data).
- Because this flow is just a single SYN packet, and the context (e.g., many similar flows in a short time) would likely show SYNs to many ports, this is **strongly indicative of a port scan**.

#### **Summary Table**

| Attribute        | Value         | Port Scan Reasoning                                              |
|------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Proto            | TCP          | Port scans typically use TCP SYN packets                         |
| Packets          | 1            | Only initial probe, not a full session                           |
| Bytes            | 58           | Typical for a SYN packet                                         |
| Flags            | ....S.       | Only SYN flag (connection attempt, not established)              |
| Dest Port        | 1271         | Unusual port, likely being tested for openness                   |
| Duration         | 0.0          | No further communication                                         |

---

### **Conclusion**

**This flow is classified as ""portScan"" because:**
- It is a single TCP SYN packet to a non-standard port,
- There is no data transfer or session establishment,
- This pattern is typical of port scanning activity, where an attacker probes various ports to discover which ones are open.

**If you had many such flows from the same source IP to different destination ports in a short timeframe, the port scan pattern would be even more evident.**

---

**In short:**  
> **A single SYN packet to a non-standard port, with no further communication, is a classic indicator of port scanning behavior.**


Explanation: 26

Let's analyze the information given and explain why this network flow was classified as **""portScan""**:

---

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Proto:** ICMP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.1  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 0  
- **Dest port:** 3.1 *(note: ICMP doesn't use ports, so this may be an artifact or mapped value)*  
- **Packets:** 5  
- **Bytes:** 350  
- **Flags:** ...... *(all dots, which means no TCP flags, as expected for ICMP)*  
- **Duration:** 4.723 seconds  

---

### Reasoning

#### 1. **ICMP Protocol**
- ICMP is commonly used for diagnostic purposes (e.g., `ping`), but it is also a tool attackers use for reconnaissance (e.g., `ping` or `ICMP` scan).

#### 2. **Number of Packets**
- 5 packets in less than 5 seconds is not inherently malicious, but in the context of ICMP, it could indicate repeated probing.

#### 3. **Port Values**
- ICMP doesn't use ports. The ""Src port"" and ""Dest port"" fields are probably placeholders or representations of ICMP type/code, or simply set to dummy values in your flow record. This is common in some flow exporters.

#### 4. **Port Scan Definition**
- A **port scan** is typically when an attacker sends packets to a range of ports on a target machine to find which ones are open. However, scanning can also occur using ICMP by checking which hosts respond to ICMP requests, or even by sending different types of ICMP messages to probe host behavior.
- This flow is not a **TCP** or **UDP** scan, but the classifier likely flagged this as a port scan because of the pattern:  
    - ICMP packets sent from one host to another,
    - potentially using different ICMP types/codes (represented by non-zero ""port"" values in your flow),  
    - no TCP flags,
    - short duration, multiple packets.

#### 5. **Why Not ""pingScan""?**
- ""pingScan"" typically refers to scanning *multiple* hosts with ICMP echo requests to discover live hosts (host discovery).  
- Here, all packets are between a single source and destination; but if the system maps ICMP type/code to ""port"" and sees multiple different codes, it may interpret this as scanning multiple ""ports"" on the same host—thus a **portScan**.

#### 6. **Why Not ""dos"" or ""bruteForce""?**
- **DoS** would involve a much higher packet rate and bytes, typically with the intention of overwhelming the target.
- **BruteForce** usually involves authentication attempts, which is not possible with ICMP.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute  | Value | Port Scan Reasoning |
|------------|-------|---------------------|
| Protocol   | ICMP  | Used for scanning/probing |
| Src/Dest IP| 1-to-1| Focused probe of a host |
| Src/Dest port | 0 / 3.1 | ICMP type/code mapped as ""port"" (e.g., scanning different ICMP types/codes) |
| Packets    | 5     | Multiple probes |
| Flags      | ......| Not TCP; ICMP is stateless |
| Duration   | 4.7s  | Burst of activity |

---

## **Conclusion**

This flow is classified as **""portScan""** because:
- The source host is sending several ICMP packets to the same destination in a short period.
- The ""Dest port"" value (3.1) suggests different ICMP type/code fields are being probed, mimicking the effect of scanning different ports (but with ICMP types/codes).
- The pattern matches typical **ICMP port scanning** behavior: probing a host with different ICMP messages to discover open/closed services or how the host responds to unexpected ICMP types/codes.

**In summary:**  
> **The flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it shows a pattern of multiple ICMP probes from one host to another, possibly with varying ICMP types/codes (represented in the 'port' fields), which is characteristic of an ICMP-based port scanning technique.**

Let’s break down the evidence from your network flow and explain why it was **classified as ""portScan""**:

### Flow Attributes Recap

---

## Key Indicators from the Flow

### 1. **Single Packet with RST/ACK Flags**
- The only packet seen in this flow has **ACK** (`A`) and **RST** (`R`) flags set.
- This means the packet is a **TCP Reset with Acknowledgment**.
    - Common scenario: A system responds with RST+ACK when it receives a connection attempt to a port where no service is listening, or when it rejects the connection.

### 2. **Zero Duration**
- The flow lasted **0.0 seconds**—it was extremely quick; a single packet exchange.
- In normal application communication, you'd expect multiple packets and some duration (e.g. connection establishment, data transfer, teardown).

### 3. **Destination Port is High and Unusual**
- The destination port is **60387**, a high-numbered port, not commonly used for standard services.
- Port scans often target a wide range of ports, especially uncommon ones, to see which are open.

### 4. **Single Packet/Single Attempt**
- Only **one packet** was observed, suggesting a probe rather than a sustained conversation or attack.

---

## **Why ""portScan""?**

A **port scan** is characterized by:
- Sending connection attempts (often just SYN packets) to various ports on a target host to identify which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
- The scanning host typically receives quick responses such as RST (if port is closed) or SYN/ACK (if port is open).

**In your flow:**
- The source (192.168.210.1) sent a packet to a high-numbered port on the destination (192.168.220.16).
- The only response was an RST+ACK, indicating the port was closed.
- There was no data transfer, just a single exchange.

This matches the typical behavior of a **TCP port scan** (especially a ""connect scan"" or after a SYN scan, where RST/ACK is returned by the server for closed ports). The scanner sends a probe, gets an RST/ACK, and moves on.

---

### **Why not other labels?**
- **dos**: Denial-of-service attacks usually involve many packets and/or connections, often to the same port.
- **bruteForce**: Brute-force attacks involve repeated login attempts, usually over established services (like SSH, FTP) with multiple packets and longer flows.
- **pingScan**: Involves ICMP packets, not TCP.
- **--- (normal)**: Normal flows usually have more than one packet, longer durations, and establish connections.

---

## **Summary**

**This flow is classified as a ""portScan"" because:**
- It consists of a single TCP packet to an uncommon, high-numbered port,
- Received a TCP RST/ACK (common for closed ports),
- No actual connection or application data was exchanged,
- This matches the behavior of a port scanning tool probing for open ports.

---

**In short:**  
> **A single, short-lived TCP flow to a rare port, resulting in a RST/ACK, is a classic pattern for a port scan probe.**


Explanation: 28

Let's analyze the network flow and explain why it makes sense that it was classified as **""portScan""**:

### Flow Attributes Recap

| Attribute      | Value                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| Start time     | 2017-03-16 19:25:53.031     |
| Duration       | 0.0                         |
| Protocol       | TCP                         |
| Src IP         | 192.168.220.16              |
| Src port       | 53392                       |
| Dest IP        | 192.168.100.6               |
| Dest port      | 705.0                       |
| Packets        | 1                           |
| Bytes          | 58                          |
| Flags          | ....S.                      |

### Key Observations

1. **Only 1 Packet Sent**  
   - A single packet is transmitted from the source to the destination.

2. **TCP SYN Flag Set (....S.)**  
   - The only flag set is the SYN flag. This indicates the start of a TCP connection (the ""handshake"" initiation).
   - No ACK, no data, no response, just an attempt to initiate a session.

3. **No Duration (0.0)**  
   - The connection attempt was not completed; it ended as soon as it started.

4. **Unusual Destination Port (705.0)**  
   - The destination port is not a common service port (like 80 or 443).
   - Scanners often probe less common ports to discover open services.

### Why is this a ""portScan""?

A **port scan** is an activity where an attacker sends connection attempts (often SYN packets) to a range of ports on a target host to discover which ports are open and potentially exploitable.

#### Evidence from this Flow

- **SYN Packet Only:**  
  Sending a single SYN packet to a destination port is a classic method used in port scanning (specifically, a ""SYN scan"" or ""half-open scan"").
- **No Further Communication:**  
  Since only one packet was sent, and the connection wasn't established, it suggests the sender is not interested in actual communication, only in learning if the port is open.
- **Unusual Port:**  
  The destination port is not a standard service, supporting the idea that the sender is probing for open ports/services.

### Why not other labels?

- **Not ""dos"":**  
  A DoS (Denial of Service) attack typically involves a large number of packets or connections attempting to overwhelm a service. Here, only one packet was sent.
- **Not ""bruteForce"":**  
  Brute-force attacks involve repeated login attempts, which would result in more packets, often with data payloads.
- **Not ""pingScan"":**  
  Ping scans use ICMP (not TCP) and look for active hosts, not open ports.
- **Not ""---"" (Normal):**  
  Normal flows usually have completed handshakes, data transfer, and more than just a SYN packet.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Behavior           | Explanation                                                                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SYN only           | Initial connection probe, no follow-up, classic sign of a port scan                  |
| Single packet      | No attempt to establish a session or transfer data                                   |
| Unusual port       | Port scanners often probe non-standard ports                                         |
| Not enough activity| Too little traffic for DoS or brute-force, not ICMP for ping scan, not normal flow   |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it consists of a single TCP SYN packet sent to an uncommon port with no subsequent packets or responses, which matches the pattern of a typical port scan.** The goal of such a scan is to identify open ports on a target system without engaging in further communication.


Explanation: 29

Let's analyze the network flow attributes and the reasoning for the **""portScan""** label:

### Flow Summary

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-17 14:06:22.156  
- **Duration:** 0.0 (instantaneous, no ongoing conversation)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.100.2  
- **Src Port:** 1300  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Dest Port:** 61477  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 54  
- **Flags:** `.A.R..` (`ACK` and `RST` set)

---

### Key Observations

1. **Single Packet, No Duration:**  
   Only one packet was seen, and the flow duration is 0.0, suggesting a single, short-lived connection attempt.

2. **TCP Flags: `.A.R..` (ACK and RST set):**  
   - The **RST** (Reset) flag means the connection was immediately reset—no communication actually took place.  
   - The **ACK** (Acknowledgment) flag is also set.  
   Typically, a TCP flow starts with a SYN packet. However, if a host receives an unexpected packet or a connection attempt to a closed port, it might reply with a RST, or the initiator itself might send a RST if it gets an unexpected response.

3. **High Destination Port:**  
   The destination port `61477` is a high, typically unused port, which is often probed in port scanning attacks to find open ports.

4. **No Data Exchange:**  
   Only 54 bytes were exchanged (likely just the TCP header), and only one packet, indicating no real session was established.

---

### Why ""portScan""?

**Port scanning** is an activity where an attacker tries to discover which ports are open on a target system by sending connection attempts to a range of ports, often with single packets to each port.

**This flow matches typical port scan behavior:**
- Attempt to connect to a high, likely unused port.
- Only a single packet exchanged (no session established).
- The response is a TCP RST (reset), which is the typical response of a host to a connection attempt on a closed port.
- No repeated communication or data exchange, which would be more typical of brute force or DOS attacks.
- The pattern is not consistent with ping scans (which use ICMP, not TCP).

---

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | Value         | PortScan Reasoning                        |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Packets           | 1            | Single, probing packet                    |
| Duration          | 0.0          | No real connection, just a probe          |
| Dest Port         | 61477        | High, uncommon port                       |
| Flags             | .A.R..       | Indicates connection was reset            |
| Protocol          | TCP          | Commonly used in port scans               |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it matches the typical characteristics of a port scan: a single TCP packet to a high port, resulting in a reset (RST) response, with no real data exchange or session establishment. This is indicative of an attempt to discover open ports on the target system.**


Explanation: 30

Let’s break down the attributes of your network flow and **explain why it was classified as a ""portScan""** attack:

---

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 38148  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.5  
- **Dest port:** 555.0  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S. (SYN only)  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Classification:** portScan

---

### Key Indicators for ""portScan"" Classification

#### 1. **Single Packet with SYN Flag Only**

- The only packet in this flow has the SYN flag set (`....S.`), and none of the other flags (ACK, RST, FIN, etc.).
- This is characteristic of the **first step in establishing a TCP connection** (the TCP 3-way handshake starts with a SYN).
- In **port scanning**, attackers send SYN packets to various ports to see which ones respond, indicating they are open.

#### 2. **Zero Duration, Minimal Data**

- **Duration is 0.0** and only **1 packet of 58 bytes** was sent.
- No data was exchanged, and there was no attempt at a full connection—just a SYN probe.
- This is typical for port scans, where the goal is to check for open ports, not to establish actual connections.

#### 3. **Unusual Destination Port**

- **Destination port is 555.0** (the `.0` is probably a formatting issue and should be just 555).
- Scanners often try non-standard or sequential ports to find services, not just common ports like 80, 443, etc.

#### 4. **Pattern Matching Known Attack Behaviors**

- **Port scans** are usually detected by identifying SYN packets sent to multiple ports or addresses in a short time, without completing connections.
- While this flow alone is just one SYN, in context (which an IDS or flow analyzer considers), **multiple such flows from the same source to different ports/IPs** strongly indicate scanning activity.

#### 5. **Not Consistent with Other Attack Types**

- **DoS attacks** typically involve many packets or large volumes of traffic.
- **Brute force** involves repeated login attempts (would see many packets and often completed connections).
- **Ping scan** uses ICMP, not TCP SYN.
- **Normal flow** would usually show completed connections (SYN, ACK, data transfer, etc.).

| Protocol            | TCP       | Port scans often use TCP SYN packets                |

| Packets             | 1         | Single packet, no handshake                         |
| Bytes               | 58        | Just enough for SYN, no data                        |
| Duration            | 0.0       | No connection established                           |
| Dest Port           | 555       | Scanning for open ports                             |

---

## **Explanation:**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it exhibits the typical behavior of a TCP SYN scan:**  
- The source host sends a single SYN packet to a specific port on the destination, with no follow-up traffic.  
- This is a classic signature of port scanning, where an attacker attempts to discover open ports without actually establishing a full connection or transferring data.  
- Such activity is not consistent with normal user behavior or other types of attacks like DoS or brute force, but is a hallmark of reconnaissance activity (port scanning) in network security monitoring.

---

**In summary:**  
> The flow matches the pattern of a port scan because it is a single SYN-only TCP packet, aimed at detecting if a port is open, without any attempt to establish a real connection or transfer data. This is a standard technique used by attackers to map out available services on a target system.

- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Dest port:** 50150  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 54  
- **Flags:** .A.R.. (ACK + RST)

---

### Explanation

#### 1. **Single Packet, Very Short Duration**
- The flow consists of **only 1 packet**.
- **Duration is 0.0 seconds** (essentially instantaneous).
- Only **54 bytes** transmitted, which is minimal for TCP traffic.

#### 2. **TCP Flags: .A.R.. (ACK + RST)**
- The flags indicate the packet has **ACK** (**A**) and **RST** (**R**) set.
- This combination is typical of a **reset** packet in TCP, often sent in response to an unexpected packet (like a connection attempt to a closed port).

#### 3. **Port Number**
- The **destination port (50150)** is a high, likely ephemeral, port.
- Port scans often target a wide range of ports, including high-numbered ones, to discover open services.

#### 4. **Behavioral Pattern**
- In a **TCP port scan** (especially a ""SYN scan""), the attacker sends a SYN packet to a target port.
    - If the port is **closed**, the target typically responds with an **RST** packet.
    - If the flow is logged from the attacker's point of view, it would consist of a **SYN** packet sent and maybe nothing more.
    - If the flow is logged from the target's point of view, it may see an **ACK+RST** response.
- The presence of only a single short-lived packet, with an RST flag, **matches the signature of a port being probed** (scanned) and found closed.

#### 5. **No Evidence of Connection or Attack Payload**
- There's **no extended connection** (no multi-packet exchange, no data transfer, no sustained attack).
- This rules out ""dos"" (which would have many packets, longer duration, and volume).
- Not ""bruteForce"" (no sequence of login attempts).
- Not ""pingScan"" (would use ICMP, not TCP).

---

### **Summary**

This flow is classified as **""portScan""** because:

- It is a **single TCP packet** with an **ACK+RST** flag, typical of a response to a port scan probe.
- The **minimal duration and byte count** indicate a probe, not a connection.
- The **high destination port** is consistent with scanning behavior.
- **No sustained communication** or attack pattern beyond a single probe.

**Port scanning** is a reconnaissance technique where an attacker sends packets to various ports to discover which ones are open. The characteristics of this flow (single packet, RST flag, ephemeral port, zero duration) match this activity.

---

**In short:**  
> The flow was classified as a ""portScan"" because its characteristics—a single, short-lived TCP packet with RST flag and no data transfer—match the typical network signature of a port scan attempt, where ports are being checked for openness without establishing a full connection.


Explanation: 32

Let's analyze the provided network flow and why it was classified as **""portScan""**:

---

### 1. **Key Details from the Flow**

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-17 16:35:04.437  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src Port:** 33535  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.210.2  
- **Dest Port:** 1086  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **TCP Flags:** ....S. (only SYN flag set)

---

### 2. **Analysis**

#### **A. TCP Flags:**
- The flag value `....S.` means that **only the SYN flag is set**.
- A SYN packet is used to **initiate a TCP connection**.

#### **B. Flow Duration & Packets:**
- **Duration is 0.0 seconds, and only 1 packet was sent.**
- This means that the connection was **not established**; only a SYN packet was sent, and no response or further packets followed.

#### **C. No Data Transfer:**
- **Only 58 bytes** (typical size of a TCP SYN packet).
- No actual data was transmitted; just the SYN handshake attempt.

#### **D. Context (Common PortScan Behavior):**
- **Port scanning** typically involves sending SYN packets to various ports (or even a single port) on a target to see which ports are open.
- The scanner sends a SYN packet and waits to see if it gets a SYN-ACK (open port) or RST (closed port).
- If only SYN packets are being sent without completing the TCP handshake or data transfer, this is a typical signature of a **""SYN scan""**, which is a common port scanning technique.

---

### 3. **Why Not the Other Labels?**

- **""---"" (Normal flow):**  
  Normal flows involve SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, and data transfer, not just a lone SYN.

- **""dos"":**  
  Denial of Service attacks involve many packets and/or high data rates to overwhelm a server. Here, just a single SYN packet was sent.

- **""bruteForce"":**  
  Brute force usually involves repeated authentication attempts, which would result in multiple packets, not just a lone SYN.

- **""pingScan"":**  
  Ping scans use ICMP, not TCP. This flow is TCP.

---

### 4. **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**

- Only a single SYN packet was sent from the source to a destination port.
- No TCP handshake was completed (no SYN-ACK, ACK, or data transfer).
- This is the hallmark of a SYN scan, a method used in port scanning to probe whether a port is open.
- There is no evidence of data transfer or authentication attempts, and it is not consistent with DoS or ICMP-based scans.

---

**In summary:**  
> The flow shows a single TCP SYN packet with no reply or further communication. This is typical of a port scan, where the attacker is probing to see if the port is open, without completing the connection or transferring data. That's why it was classified as **""portScan""**.


Explanation: 33

Certainly! Let's break down **why this flow was classified as ""portScan"":**

### Key Flow Attributes:
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP/Port:** 192.168.220.16:53392
- **Destination IP/Port:** 192.168.100.1:3659
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 58
- **Flags:** ....S. (Only the SYN flag is set)
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds

### What is a Port Scan?
A **Port Scan** is a technique used to identify open ports and services available on a target machine. Attackers (or network tools) send packets (often with only the SYN flag set) to various ports on a destination. If the port is open, the server responds; otherwise, it ignores or rejects the probe. By iterating over many ports, an attacker can map the services available on a host.

### Why this flow looks like a port scan:

1. **SYN-Only (....S.) Packet:**
   - The flow consists of **a single TCP packet with only the SYN flag** set. This is the first step in initiating a TCP connection, known as a ""SYN scan"" or ""half-open scan.""  
   - Port scanning tools (like Nmap) often use SYN packets to probe ports without completing the handshake, to avoid detection or logging.

2. **Single Packet, No Data Exchange:**
   - Only **one packet** was sent, and there was **no reply**, indicating no handshake was completed.
   - This suggests the sender is checking if the port is open, not attempting to communicate beyond the probe.

3. **Random/Uncommon Destination Port:**
   - Destination port **3659** is not a commonly used port (like 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS), which is typical in scans that sweep through many ports.

4. **Short Duration:**
   - **Duration is 0.0 seconds**: As expected, since it’s just a single SYN probe, not a sustained session.

### Why not other attack types?
- **Normal (---):** Normal traffic usually involves a full handshake and more than a single SYN packet.
- **DoS:** A DoS attack involves overwhelming the target with a large number of packets, which is not the case here.
- **BruteForce:** Brute force attacks involve repeated connection attempts, usually with authentication tries, not just a single SYN.
- **PingScan:** Uses ICMP echo (ping) packets, not TCP SYN packets.

## **Summary Table:**

| Attribute        | Value                      | PortScan Indicator?      |
|------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Proto            | TCP                       | Yes                      |
| Packets          | 1                         | Yes                      |
| Flags            | SYN only (....S.)         | Yes                      |
| Duration         | 0.0                       | Yes                      |
| Dest Port        | 3659 (uncommon)           | Yes (likely a scan port) |

---

## **Conclusion:**
This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it matches the typical behavior of a port scan: a single SYN packet sent to a potentially random port, with no follow-up or data exchange. Such patterns are characteristic of automated tools probing for open ports, not of legitimate traffic or the other attack types listed.

**If you have more flows or questions, feel free to ask!**


Explanation: 34

Let’s break down the flow and its attributes to understand **why** it was classified as a **""portScan""**:

### Flow Details

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-21 14:15:20.200  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source Port:** 52086  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.210.5  
- **Destination Port:** 1641  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S. (Only the SYN flag is set)

---

## Step-by-step Reasoning

### 1. **Single Packet, Only SYN Flag Set**
- The TCP flag is **SYN** (`....S.`), indicating this packet is attempting to initiate a connection (the very first step in the TCP handshake).
- No **ACK**, **FIN**, or **RST**: There is no evidence of the connection being established, data exchanged, or closed.

### 2. **No Data Transfer**
- Only **1 packet** and **58 bytes** (which matches the typical size of a TCP SYN packet with no payload).
- **Duration is 0.0 seconds**: Implies no follow-up traffic, just a single attempt.

### 3. **Behavior Pattern**
- A **single SYN packet** to a destination port, with no follow-up, is a hallmark of **port scanning**:
    - Attackers (or scanners) send SYN packets to various ports on a host to see which ones are open (respond with SYN-ACK).
    - If the port is open, the target replies; if closed, it may reply with RST or nothing at all.
    - The scanner often does not complete the handshake (i.e., does not send ACK), so the connection is not established.

### 4. **No Indication of Other Attack Types**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Usually involves a flood of packets, not just a single SYN.
- **Brute Force:** Involves repeated attempts to authenticate (typically lots of traffic, not a single SYN).
- **Ping Scan:** Would use ICMP protocol, not TCP.
- **Normal Flow:** A typical connection would proceed with SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, data, etc.

---

## **Conclusion: Why ""portScan""?**

- **A single SYN packet** to a specific port without follow-up is classic scanning behavior.
- **Port Scans** are reconnaissance: mapping out which ports are open by sending SYNs and analyzing the responses.
- If many such flows (SYNs to different ports) are observed from 192.168.220.16, it would be clear scanning activity.

---

### **Summary Table**
| Attribute | Value | Why This Suggests PortScan |
|-----------|-------|---------------------------|
| Protocol | TCP | Port scans use TCP SYN packets |
| Packets | 1 | Only one attempt, typical for scans |
| Flags | ....S. | SYN only, start of TCP scan |
| Duration | 0.0 | No further communication |
| Bytes | 58 | Minimal, SYN packet only |

**Therefore, this flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it matches the pattern of scanning for open ports using SYN packets without completing connections.**

---

**If you see many such flows with different destination ports, it's even more clearly a port scan.**


Explanation: 35

Let's analyze your network flow and why it was classified as a **""portScan""**:

---

### **Flow Attributes Recap:**

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-15 14:18:41.925  
- **Duration:** 0.0 (very short, almost instant)
- **Proto:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.2
- **Src Port:** 902
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Dest Port:** 33168
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 54
- **Flags:** `.A.R..` (ACK and RST flags set, in that order)

---

## **Step-by-Step Reasoning**

### 1. **What is a Port Scan?**
A **port scan** is when an attacker systematically sends packets to a range of ports on a target machine to discover open, closed, or filtered ports. The goal is to identify services running on the target for further exploitation.

### 2. **Indicators in Your Flow:**
- **Single Packet, Short Duration:**  
  The flow consists of only one packet, and the duration is 0.0 seconds, suggesting a simple probe rather than an ongoing connection or data transfer.
- **TCP Flags: `.A.R..` (ACK, RST):**  
  This means the packet had the ACK and RST flags set.  
  - **RST (Reset):** Indicates that the recipient is forcefully closing the connection, often because there's no service listening at the destination port or the connection is unexpected.
  - **ACK (Acknowledgement):** Typically used to acknowledge receipt of data, but in scanning, it can be used to probe firewall rules or closed ports.
- **Unusual Destination Port:**  
  The destination port `33168` is a high, non-standard port, which is commonly targeted during scans to look for unknown or custom services.

### 3. **Why is this a Port Scan?**
- **TCP RST-ACK Packet:**  
  Port scanning tools often send SYN, ACK, or other flag combinations to probe ports. When a system receives a packet on a port with no service, it often responds with a RST (reset). Seeing only a single RST-ACK response suggests a scan was probing that port, and the port was closed or unexpected.
- **No Real Data Exchange:**  
  Only one packet, no session established, and no data transferred. Legitimate traffic usually involves more packets and longer durations.
- **Pattern:**  
  When multiple such flows are seen (from the same source, to many destination ports), it's a clear signature of port scanning.

### 4. **Why Not Other Attack Types?**
- **Not DoS:**  
  DoS attacks involve overwhelming the target with traffic; here, it's just one packet.
- **Not Brute Force:**  
  Brute force attacks involve repeated attempts to authenticate (e.g., login attempts), not present here.
- **Not Ping Scan:**  
  Ping scans use ICMP packets, not TCP.
- **Not Normal:**  
  Normal flows involve established sessions and legitimate data transfer.

## **Summary Table**

| Feature                     | Value                  | PortScan Indicator?           |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Packets                     | 1                      | Yes (typical of scan probes)  |
| Duration                    | 0.0                    | Yes (just a probe)            |
| Flags                       | .A.R.. (ACK, RST)      | Yes (scan response)           |
| Dest Port                   | 33168 (high, random)   | Yes (scans target many ports) |
| Protocol                    | TCP                    | Yes (common scan protocol)    |
| Data Volume                 | 54 bytes               | Yes (just a header, likely)   |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**

- It is a single, very short TCP connection attempt to a high-numbered port.
- The response is a RST-ACK packet, which is typical when a port scan probe hits a closed port.
- There is no data exchange, consistent with scanning behavior rather than normal activity.

**If you see many such flows to different ports from the same source IP, it is a clear signature of a port scan.**

---

**In short:**  
*This flow fits the classic pattern of a TCP port scan: a single, brief probe to a high port, receiving a RST-ACK in response, with no real session established.*


Explanation: 36

Let's break down the network flow attributes and the possible attack labels:

---

**Flow Attributes:**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-21 13:01:43.103  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 38148  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.8  
- **Dest port:** 1028  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S. (SYN flag set)

---

**Why is this flow classified as ""portScan""?**

**1. SYN Scan Characteristic:**
- The TCP flags show only the SYN flag is set (....S.), which means this is an initial connection attempt, not part of a longer session.  
- Only **1 packet** was sent, with **58 bytes**—typical for a TCP SYN packet.

**2. No Response / Connection Establishment:**
- The **duration is 0.0**, and there is only one packet. This indicates that the connection was not established, and no data was exchanged.  
- In port scans, attackers typically send SYN packets to various ports/IPs to see which ones respond (are open), without completing the connection.

**3. Destination Port:**
- The flow is directed to port **1028** on the destination IP. Port scans often target a range of ports, not just well-known ones.

**4. Not a DoS, brute force, or ping scan:**
- **DoS**: Would involve many packets, often with established connections or floods.
- **BruteForce**: Would show many attempts with the same port, usually with multiple packets and connection attempts.
- **PingScan**: Would use ICMP, not TCP.

**5. Typical Signature of Port Scan:**
- A SYN-only packet, with no further traffic, is a classic signature of a TCP SYN scan, where the scanner tries to discover open ports by sending SYN packets and analyzing responses.

---

### **Summary**

This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:
- Only a single TCP SYN packet was sent (indicated by the TCP flags and packet count).
- The flow duration is zero, and no connection was established.
- Such flows are typical of port scan activity, where the attacker is probing to see if a specific port is open, without actually engaging in a full connection or attack.

**In short:**  
**A single SYN packet to a port, with no further communication, is a textbook indicator of a port scan attempt.**


Explanation: 37

Let’s break down the attributes of your network flow and explain **why it was classified as a ""portScan""**:

---

### **Flow Attributes**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 12:03:02.363
- **Duration:** 0.0 (instantaneous)
- **Proto:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Src port:** 49894
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.100.181
- **Dest port:** 80
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 54
- **Flags:** .A.... (only the ACK flag is set)

---

### **Reasoning for ""portScan"" Classification**

#### 1. **Single Packet, Single Byte Count**
- Only **1 packet** (54 bytes) was sent.  
- This is typical of scanning activity, where the attacker sends a minimal packet to probe for open ports or services.

#### 2. **TCP ACK Flag Only**
- The only flag set is **ACK (Acknowledged)**.
- In normal TCP communication, an ACK packet is a response to a SYN/ACK during the handshake, or part of established communication.
- However, **receiving a single ACK packet without any prior handshake** is unusual and often used in certain types of scans, such as **ACK scans**, which are used to map firewall rules or detect open ports in a stealthy manner.

#### 3. **Duration = 0.0**
- The flow lasted for 0 seconds, indicating no established or ongoing communication—just a single probe.

#### 4. **Destination Port 80**
- Port 80 is the default HTTP port, commonly targeted in scans to identify web servers.

#### 5. **No Apparent Attack Activity**
- There are no signs of a DoS attack (which would involve many packets or high volume), brute force (would see repeated connection attempts), or ping scan (would involve ICMP, not TCP).

#### 6. **Typical PortScan Behavior**
- Port scans often involve sending a single packet to a port to determine if it is open and listening.
- The use of an ACK packet in particular is characteristic of **TCP ACK scanning**, a technique used to map firewall rulesets and distinguish between filtered and unfiltered ports.

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute                  | Value                  | Relevance to PortScan                       |
|----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Packets                    | 1                      | Minimal probing, typical of scanning        |
| Bytes                      | 54                     | Small, non-communicative payload            |
| TCP Flags                  | .A.... (ACK only)      | Indicative of an ACK scan                   |
| Duration                   | 0.0                    | No real session, just a probe               |
| Destination Port           | 80                     | Common port to scan                         |

---

## **Conclusion**
This flow was classified as a **portScan** because it has all the hallmarks of a scanning probe:
- Single TCP ACK packet,
- To a common service port,
- No actual session established,
- Minimal data exchanged.

Such patterns are **typical of reconnaissance activity** where an attacker is mapping the network to identify open ports or firewall rules.

Explanation: 38

Let’s break down the flow and explain **why it was classified as a ""portScan""**:

---

## Flow Attributes Recap

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-20 12:05:16.763  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source Port:** 50151  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.100.1  
- **Destination Port:** 211.0  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S.

---

## Key Observations

1. **Single Packet, SYN Flag Only (`....S.`):**
   - The only flag present is **SYN** (`S`). This means it is likely the start of a TCP connection attempt.
   - There is no ACK, no FIN, no RST, etc.
   - This is typical of a TCP handshake *initiation*.

2. **Zero Duration, Only One Packet:**
   - The flow lasted essentially zero time and only one packet was sent.
   - This usually means the connection was not established (i.e., no SYN-ACK or further communication).

3. **Unusual Destination Port (`211.0`):**
   - The destination port is non-standard and uncommon.
   - Port scans frequently target a range of ports, including many that are not commonly used.

---

## Why is this a **PortScan**?

### How Port Scans Work

- A **port scan** is a technique used to discover which TCP/UDP ports are open or closed on a target machine.  
- The most basic form is a **SYN scan**: the attacker sends a TCP SYN packet to each port of the target. If the port is open, the victim responds with SYN-ACK; if closed, RST or no response.
- The scanner usually sends *only* the initial SYN packet, doesn't complete the handshake, and does this to many ports or hosts.

### Comparing to Other Attack Types

- **DoS:** Would have many packets, high volume, often to a single target/service.
- **BruteForce:** Would have multiple connection attempts to the same service, likely more packets, and completed handshakes.
- **PingScan:** Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **Normal:** Would have a completed handshake and likely data transfer (not just a single SYN).

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute            | Value        | PortScan? | Why?                                            |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Protocol             | TCP          | ✔         | SYN scan is common port scan method             |
| TCP Flags            | SYN only     | ✔         | Only SYN, typical of scan, not real connection  |
| Packets              | 1            | ✔         | One-off SYN, no handshake                       |
| Duration             | 0.0          | ✔         | No actual session established                   |
| Destination Port     | 211.0        | ✔         | Scans often probe uncommon ports                |

---

## **Final Explanation**

This network flow was classified as **""portScan""** because:

- The flow consists of a single TCP SYN packet (no data, no handshake completed),
- The destination port is unusual,
- The connection was not established (0 duration, 1 packet),
- This behavior matches the classic signature of a TCP SYN port scan, where an attacker probes multiple ports with SYN packets to detect which are open.

**In summary:**  
> The flow is a typical example of a port scan attempt, where the attacker sends a single SYN packet to an uncommon port, with no further communication, to determine if that port is open, which is why it is classified as ""portScan"".

## **Reasoning**

### **1. Port Scan Behavior**

A **port scan** is an activity where an attacker sends packets to various ports on a target machine to discover which ports are open, closed, or filtered. Several characteristics of your flow match typical port scan signatures:

#### **a. Single Packet**
- **Only 1 packet sent**: Port scans often send a single probe packet to many ports, rather than establishing a full connection.

#### **b. TCP Flags: `.A.R..` (ACK, RST)**
- This combination is **not a typical handshake** (which would involve SYN or SYN/ACK). Instead, it's a **reset** with ACK.
- This is often seen as a response to a probe, or as part of a scan technique (e.g., **ACK or RST scans**).
- In many TCP scan types (like ACK scans or Xmas scans), packets with ""odd"" flag combinations are used to elicit different firewall or stack responses for fingerprinting.

#### **c. Unusual Destination Port**
- The **destination port (33508)** is high and likely not a standard service, which is common during scans (probing non-standard ports).

#### **d. Zero Duration**
- **Duration is 0.0**: Implies that the connection was not established, just a single packet exchange.

#### **e. Small Number of Bytes**
- Only **54 bytes** sent: typical size for a bare TCP packet (with no payload).

---

### **2. Why Not Other Attack Types?**

- **DoS**: Usually involves many packets, often to a single port/service, designed to overwhelm.
- **BruteForce**: Involves repeated login attempts, usually with more than one packet and likely to the same port.
- **PingScan**: Uses ICMP, not TCP.
- **No attack (---)**: The flow is anomalous compared to normal connection patterns.

## **Summary Table**

| Feature                  | Normal Flow | PortScan | This Flow |
|--------------------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Packets                  | Multiple    | 1        | 1         |
| Duration                 | >0          | 0        | 0         |
| TCP Flags                | SYN/ACK/FIN | Odd      | ACK/RST   |
| Dest Port                | Known       | Random   | 33508     |
| Protocol                 | Any         | TCP      | TCP       |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**
- It consists of a single TCP packet with an unusual flag combination (ACK/RST),
- Sent to a high, likely non-service port,
- With zero duration and minimal data exchanged.

**These are all strong indicators of a port scanning activity, where an attacker is probing the target for open (or responsive) ports.**


Explanation: 40

Let's break down the network flow attributes and the logic behind classifying it as a **""portScan""**:

### Flow Attributes and Their Significance

- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-16 16:55:03.765  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
  (This means the flow was extremely short—essentially a single packet, with no follow-up communication.)
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 53392  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.100.4  
- **Dest port:** 1494  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S.  
  (Only the SYN flag is set.)

---

### Analysis

1. **Single Packet, SYN Only:**
   - The flow consists of **one TCP packet** with the SYN flag set (`....S.`).
   - No ACK, FIN, RST, or other flags appear—just the initial connection attempt.
   - **No response** or follow-up packet.

2. **Short Duration:**
   - The duration is **0.0 seconds**, further confirming it's just a single handshake attempt.

3. **No Data Transfer:**
   - Only 58 bytes (roughly the size of a TCP SYN packet).
   - No further data exchanged.

4. **Destination Port:**
   - The destination port is **1494** (Citrix ICA protocol, but that's less relevant to the classification logic).

---

### Why is this a ""portScan"" and not another attack type?

- **Port Scans** are characterized by sending SYN packets to a range of ports (or to a single port as part of a sweep) to determine if the port is open. The attacker typically does **not** complete the TCP handshake; they just look for SYN-ACK responses.
- In a **DoS** attack, you would see many packets, possibly with repeated SYNs (SYN flood) or lots of traffic, not just a single SYN packet.
- A **bruteForce** attack would show multiple connection attempts to the same service, often with completed handshakes and failed authentication.
- **PingScan** would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **Normal traffic** would typically show a SYN, followed by SYN-ACK, ACK, and data transfer.

---

### **Summary:**
This flow fits the classic pattern of a **TCP SYN scan** (a type of port scan):

- **A single SYN packet**
- **No further communication**
- **No data exchange**
- **Short duration**

Such flows are often generated by port scanning tools (e.g., nmap) probing to see if a port is open.

---

## **Conclusion**
**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it consists of a single TCP SYN packet with no further communication, which is a typical signature of a port scanning attempt.** Port scans probe ports to see which ones are open, without establishing a full connection.

Explanation: 41

Let's break down the network flow attributes you provided and analyze why it was classified as **""portScan""**:

### Network Flow Attributes

- **Start time:** 2017-03-17 13:56:34.520  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.100.5  
- **Source Port:** 1111  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Destination Port:** 61477  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 54  
- **Flags:** .A.R..

#### TCP Flags: `.A.R..`
- **A** (ACK): Acknowledgment
- **R** (RST): Reset

So, the TCP packet contained both the ACK and RST flags.

---

## Analysis

### 1. **Single Packet, No Data Transfer**
- Only **1 packet** was sent, and the duration is **0.0 seconds**. This suggests a single, very brief interaction.

### 2. **Unusual TCP Flags**
- The presence of only **ACK** and **RST** is uncommon in normal flows. Typically, a normal TCP connection starts with a SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK handshake.
- An **ACK+RST** packet is often used to abruptly close a connection or to respond to unexpected packets (like when a port is probed that has no listening service).

### 3. **High Destination Port**
- The destination port (**61477**) is a high, likely ephemeral port, not commonly used by standard services. Port scans often target a range of ports, especially high-numbered ones, to discover open services.

### 4. **No Ongoing Communication**
- The lack of a handshake or data transfer (just 1 packet) is atypical for legitimate connections, but typical for scans, where the attacker just wants to check if a port is open.

---

## **Why ""portScan""?**

### **Port Scanning Behavior**
A **port scan** involves sending packets to different ports on a target machine to discover which ones are open and listening for connections. This often involves:
- Sending single packets to a range of ports.
- Using unusual flag combinations to elicit responses from the target.

### **ACK+RST in Scans**
- Some scanning tools (like Nmap) send **ACK** or **ACK+RST** packets to see how the target responds. The response (or lack thereof) can reveal if the port is filtered, closed, or open.
- The **ACK+RST** combination is used to probe the state of a port without completing a handshake.

### **No Attack, but Not Normal**
- Normal connections involve SYN packets, handshakes, and data transfer.
- This flow shows none of that: just a single, out-of-context packet with unusual flags to a high-numbered port.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute           | Value                    | PortScan Indicator?             |
|---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Packets             | 1                       | Yes (scan, not connection)      |
| Duration            | 0.0                     | Yes                             |
| TCP Flags           | .A.R..                  | Yes (unusual in normal traffic) |
| Destination Port    | 61477                   | Yes (high port, typical in scans)|
| Data transferred    | 54 bytes (header only)  | Yes (no payload)                |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**
- It consists of a single TCP packet with ACK+RST flags (unusual for normal traffic).
- It targets a high-numbered port.
- There’s no handshake or data transfer.
- This pattern matches common port scanning behaviors, where attackers send probe packets to many ports to map open services, often using flag combinations like ACK+RST to infer information about the target’s firewall or port state.

**If you have more flows from the same source IP to various destination ports in a similar pattern, that would further reinforce the port scan classification.**


Explanation: 42

Let's break down your network flow and explain **why** it was classified as a **""portScan""**.

---

### **Network Flow Details**

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-21 13:03:54.380
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.200.2
- **Source Port:** 16016
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Destination Port:** 38148
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 54
- **TCP Flags:** `.A.R..` (ACK, RST)

---

## **Key Points for Classification**

### 1. **Single Packet, Very Short Duration**
- **Only 1 packet** transmitted.
- **Duration is 0.0s**: This suggests the connection was immediately closed or rejected.

### 2. **TCP Flags: `.A.R..`**
- This means the only flags set are **ACK** and **RST**.
- A **RST (reset)** with **ACK** is typically sent **in response to an unsolicited or refused TCP connection**; for example, if a host receives a packet for a port that isn't open, it may respond with RST/ACK.

### 3. **No Attack Payload**
- Only 54 bytes: This is consistent with a minimal TCP header, not a data payload (i.e., not a brute force, no data transfer, not DoS).

### 4. **Flow Pattern**
- **Port scans** often involve sending packets to a range of ports or hosts, just to check which ports are open.
- The classic scan types (like SYN scan, ACK scan, etc.) often result in single-packet flows with RST/ACK flags in response.
- The **source port is random** (16016), destination port is high (38148), suggesting automation/tool use.

### 5. **No Repeated Connections**
- **Brute force** attacks would involve repeated attempts, often with data payloads.
- **DoS** would involve many packets, not just one.
- **Ping scan** uses ICMP, but this is a TCP flow.

---

## **Why Not the Other Labels?**

- **""---"" (Normal flow):**  
  Normal flows usually involve a successful handshake and some data transfer, not just a single rejected packet.

- **""dos"":**  
  DoS involves many packets or connections, aimed at overwhelming the target, not a single-packet probe.

- **""bruteForce"":**  
  Brute force attacks have multiple attempts, often with repeated logins or data.

- **""pingScan"":**  
  Ping scans use ICMP, not TCP.

---

## **Why ""portScan""?**

- The observed behavior (single TCP packet, immediate RST/ACK response, no payload, high port) is **typical of an automated port scanning tool** checking if a port is open.
- The scan tool sends a probe to a specific port, receives a RST/ACK if the port is closed (which is what happened here), and moves on.
- **This pattern matches the ""portScan"" attack profile** in many intrusion detection systems.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Label        | Why Not?                                      |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| ---          | Not normal: only one packet with RST/ACK      |
| dos          | Not enough packets/connections                |
| bruteForce   | No repeated attempts, no data payload         |
| pingScan     | Not ICMP, this is TCP                         |
| portScan     | **Single probe, RST/ACK, no payload: matches**|

---

**In summary:**  
This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it matches the typical pattern of a port scan: a single TCP probe to a high port, resulting in an immediate RST/ACK with no payload. This is how scanning tools map which ports are open or closed on a target host.

Certainly! Let's analyze the flow in the context of its classification as **""portScan""**.

### Flow Attributes Recap

| Attribute         | Value                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Start Time        | 2017-03-16 18:18:46.386       |
| Duration          | 0.0 seconds                   |
| Protocol          | TCP                           |
| Src IP            | 192.168.100.2                 |
| Src Port          | 5901                          |
| Dest IP           | 192.168.220.16                |
| Dest Port         | 53392                         |
| Packets           | 1                             |
| Bytes             | 54                            |
| Flags             | .A.R..                        |

### Key Observations

#### 1. **Single Packet Flow**
- Only **1 packet** was transmitted.
- The **duration is 0.0**, indicating a very brief, possibly incomplete connection.

#### 2. **TCP Flags: `.A.R..`**
- **A**: ACK (Acknowledgment)
- **R**: RST (Reset)
- No SYN (S, which is used to initiate a TCP connection), no data transfer.

  The `.A.R..` flag combination is unusual for ordinary communication but is often seen in responses to unsolicited or abnormal connection attempts.

#### 3. **Source and Destination Ports**
- Source port: 5901 (commonly VNC, but not significant here)
- Destination port: 53392 (high, ephemeral port)

#### 4. **Volume**
- **54 bytes**: This is the typical size of a minimal TCP header packet.

### Why ""portScan""?

#### **Typical Characteristics of a Port Scan:**
- **Port scans** involve sending packets to a range of ports on a target host to identify open, closed, or filtered ports.
- Often, each connection attempt is very brief, sometimes only a single packet, as the attacker is not interested in establishing a full connection but just in learning the port's state.

#### **Matching This Flow**

- **Single packet, no data exchange:** This matches what you'd expect during a scan, not a real connection.
- **RST+ACK flags:** A RST (reset) in response to a non-existent or unsolicited connection is typical of a port that is closed or rejecting the connection. Often, a port scan tool sends a SYN or some other probe, and if the port is closed, the server responds with RST+ACK (as seen here).
- **No SYN handshake:** Absence of SYN suggests this is not a legitimate connection initiation, but rather a response to a scan or probe.
- **Unusual port number:** Scans often target a range of ports, including high numbered ephemeral ports.

### **Summary**

This flow was classified as **""portScan""** because:
- It involves **only a single packet** with **no data exchanged** (just 54 bytes).
- The packet has **RST+ACK flags**, a common response to an unsolicited probe (like from a scanner).
- The **duration is zero**, meaning it was not a real connection.
- These characteristics are typical of **port scanning activity**, where an attacker is quickly probing ports to find which are open, without engaging in a full handshake or data transfer.

**In short:**  
**A single, zero-duration TCP packet with RST+ACK flags and no SYN, targeting a high port, is exactly what you'd expect from a port scan probe, not from a normal or attack connection (like DoS or brute force).**

---

**If you want a more technical reference:**  
A port scan (such as nmap) often results in the target machine sending back RST+ACK packets in response to probes on closed ports, which matches what is seen in this flow.


Explanation: 44

Certainly! Let's break down the attributes of your flow and explain **why it was classified as a ""portScan""**:

---

### **Flow Attributes**

- **Start time:** 2017-03-16 13:47:06.054  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source port:** 47080  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.210.3  
- **Destination port:** 2099  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **TCP Flags:** ....S. (Only SYN flag set)

---

## **Analysis**

### **Key Observations**

1. **Single Packet (SYN Only):**
   - The flow consists of **only one packet** with **only the SYN flag set** (`....S.`).
   - This is the initial step in establishing a TCP connection (the ""SYN"" of the TCP three-way handshake).
   - There are **no ACK**, **no data**, and the connection was **not completed**.

2. **Short Duration & No Data Transfer:**
   - The duration is **0.0 seconds**, indicating it was an instantaneous attempt.
   - Only **58 bytes** transferred, which is consistent with the size of a TCP SYN packet.

3. **Unusual Destination Port:**
   - The destination port is **2099**, which is not a common service port (like 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS).
   - Port scans often target **many ports**, including uncommon ones, to discover open services.

---

### **Why is this a ""portScan""?**

A **port scan** is a technique attackers (or network administrators) use to **probe a range of ports on a target machine** to see which ports are open and accepting connections. The most common way to do this is by sending SYN packets (the first step of a TCP handshake) to a large number of ports, then observing which ports respond.

#### **Indicators in Your Flow:**

- **SYN-only packet:** Classic indicator of a scan. Attackers send SYNs and watch for SYN-ACK responses (indicating open ports) or RSTs (indicating closed ports).
- **No completed handshake:** The flow does not proceed beyond the SYN, meaning it isn't a legitimate attempt to establish a connection.
- **Single packet, single port:** While this flow is just one event, in the context of network monitoring, a series of such flows from the same source, each targeting different ports, would strongly indicate a port scan.
- **Unusual port:** Port scans often target non-standard ports in addition to common ones.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute      | Value            | PortScan Indicator?            |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| SYN only       | Yes              | **Yes** (SYN scan)            |
| 1 packet       | Yes              | **Yes** (probing)             |
| 0 bytes data   | Yes (header only)| **Yes** (no real connection)  |
| Uncommon port  | Yes (2099)       | **Yes**                       |
| No handshake   | Yes              | **Yes**                       |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow is classified as ""portScan"" because it matches the typical signature of a SYN scan:**  
- Only a SYN flag is set,
- Only one packet is sent,
- No actual data or handshake,
- Unusual destination port,
- Very short duration.

**Port scanning** is a precursor to many network attacks, and catching SYN-only flows to multiple ports is a common way to detect it.

---

**If you see many such flows from the same source IP to different destination ports, it is almost certainly a port scan.**

Let's break down the provided flow and explain why it is classified as **""portScan""**:

### Your Flow Details

| Attribute         | Value                     |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Start time**    | 2017-03-17 13:28:53.918  |

| **Bytes**         | 58                       |
| **Flags**         | ....S. (SYN only)        |

---

## Analysis

### 1. **Single Packet, SYN Only**
- The **Flags** field is `....S.`, meaning only the **SYN** flag is set.
    - **SYN** packets are used to initiate a TCP connection.
    - A flow with only a SYN packet (and no response, no ACK, no established connection) often indicates a **connection attempt**, not a full connection.

### 2. **Flow Duration is 0.0**
- The flow lasted **0 seconds**—this means there was no established session, only a single event.

### 3. **One Packet, 58 Bytes**
- Only **one packet** sent, no data exchanged.
- This is typical for a TCP handshake attempt that gets **no reply**.

### 4. **Destination Port**
- The destination port is **1033**—not a typical port for common services.
- Port scans often target random or less common ports to check for open services.

---

## Why is this a **Port Scan**?

### **How Port Scans Work**
- A port scan is when an attacker sends packets (typically SYN packets) to many ports or many hosts to identify which ports are open and listening.
- A **typical scan** sends just a SYN packet to each target port and awaits a response.
    - If a SYN-ACK is received, the port is open.
    - If RST or no response, the port is closed or filtered.

### **Key Indicators in This Flow**
- **SYN Only:** Only the SYN flag is set—no further handshake, no data transfer.
- **Single Packet:** No reply from the target, so no connection established.
- **Random/Unusual Port:** Targeting port 1033, which is not a standard service port.
- **Short Duration:** Flow lasted 0 seconds—just a single probe.
- **Behavior:** This is typical of a **""stealth scan""** (sometimes called a SYN scan or half-open scan).

### **Normal Traffic vs. Port Scan**
- **Normal Connection:** You'd see SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK, possibly followed by data packets.
- **Port Scan:** Just a SYN, no follow-up, often across many ports in a short time.

---

## **Conclusion**

This flow is classified as a **""portScan""** because:
- It consists of a single SYN packet from a source to a destination port, with no handshake or data exchange.
- The characteristics (SYN-only, single packet, random port, no session) match the typical behavior of port scanning activity, where the attacker is probing for open TCP ports.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Feature               | Normal Flow         | Port Scan (Your Flow)     |
|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **Flags**             | SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK  | SYN only                  |
| **Packets**           | Multiple           | 1                         |
| **Duration**          | >0                 | 0                         |
| **Ports**             | Known/service      | Unusual/random            |
| **Purpose**           | Communication      | Probe for open port       |

---

**In short:**  
Your flow shows classic signs of a port scan: a single SYN packet to a non-standard port, with no response or further communication. This is why it was labeled as ""portScan"".


Explanation: 46

Let's analyze your network flow:

**Flow Attributes:**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-17 15:55:24.073  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source port:** 33535  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.210.2  
- **Destination port:** 22.0  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S. (only the SYN flag is set)

**Label:** portScan

---

### Why is this flow classified as ""portScan""?

#### 1. **Single SYN Packet (....S.)**
- The only flag set is SYN, which means this packet is trying to **initiate a new TCP connection**.
- No ACK, FIN, or RST flags are set, indicating there is **no response** yet, and it’s just the initial connection attempt.

#### 2. **Duration = 0.0, Packets = 1, Bytes = 58**
- The flow consists of **one packet** only, with a very short (effectively zero) duration.
- This suggests **no actual communication** took place—just an initial connection attempt.

#### 3. **Destination Port 22 (SSH)**
- Attackers often scan for open ports by sending SYN packets to common service ports (like 22 for SSH).
- Port 22 is a frequent target for attackers looking for SSH servers.

#### 4. **Characteristics of a Port Scan**
- **Port scans** often involve sending SYN packets to various ports to see which ones respond (indicating they're open).
- If a host receives many single SYN packets to different ports, it is usually being scanned.
- **This flow fits that pattern:** a single SYN packet, no established connection.

#### 5. **No evidence of actual attack or exploitation**
- **No multiple packets**, **no login attempts**, **no data transfer**. 
- **No evidence of a denial of service (dos)** (not enough traffic).
- **No evidence of brute force** (no repeated authentication attempts).
- **Not a ping scan** (that would use ICMP, not TCP).

## **Final Explanation**

> The flow is labeled **""portScan""** because it consists of a single TCP SYN packet (with no follow-up communication) sent to a common service port (22/SSH). This pattern matches the typical behavior of a port scan, where an attacker probes a target to discover which ports are open by sending SYN packets and seeing which ones respond. There is no evidence of actual exploitation or service interaction, only reconnaissance activity.

If you saw many such flows from the same source to different ports, that would further confirm a port scan. Even a single such flow is often classified as reconnaissance/port scan in automated detection systems.


Explanation: 47

Let's break down the information and explain **why this flow was classified as ""portScan"":**

### **Flow Attributes**
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S. (**SYN flag set**)  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 38148  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.3  
- **Dest port:** 161.0  

### **Key Observations**
1. **Single Packet, SYN Only:**  
   The flow contains only **one TCP packet** with the SYN flag set (`....S.`), which is the first step in establishing a TCP connection (the ""SYN"" in the TCP three-way handshake).

2. **No Data Transmission:**  
   Only 58 bytes (typical for a TCP SYN packet), and the flow duration is 0.0 seconds—this suggests **no actual data transfer** or further communication.

3. **Destination Port:**  
   Destination port **161** is used by SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), which is not a common port for general traffic and is often targeted by scans.

### **Why is this a Port Scan?**
- A **port scan** typically involves sending SYN packets to various ports on a target host to **discover open, closed, or filtered ports**. The attacker doesn't complete the TCP handshake; they just look for responses to see which ports are open.
- In this case, **the flow shows a SYN packet sent to port 161** from a high-numbered source port, which is exactly what a port scan does: probes a port with a SYN to see if it’s open.
- **No further packets** (no ACK, no data transfer) indicate that the source was not trying to establish a normal connection or send/receive data, but just probing.

### **Why not one of the other labels?**
- **""dos"":** Denial of service attacks typically involve a **large volume of packets or flows** attempting to overwhelm the target; this is only one packet.
- **""bruteForce"":** Brute force attacks would show **multiple connection attempts** to a service (often with failed logins), not just a single SYN probe.
- **""pingScan"":** Would be **ICMP protocol** (not TCP) and involve ICMP Echo Requests.
- **""---"" (Normal):** A normal flow would show more packets, possibly data exchange, or a completed handshake, not just a single SYN.

---

## **Summary**
**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it consists of a single TCP SYN packet to a specific port, which is a classic indicator of a port scan.** There is no evidence of a completed connection or data transfer, and the behavior matches that of a scanning tool probing for open ports. This pattern differentiates it from normal traffic and from other attack types.


Explanation: 48

Let's break down your flow and explain why it was classified as `""portScan""`:

### Flow Summary

- **Start time**: 2017-03-21 13:01:31.432
- **Duration**: 0.0 seconds
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Src IP**: 192.168.200.1
- **Src port**: 587
- **Dest IP**: 192.168.220.16
- **Dest port**: 38148
- **Packets**: 1
- **Bytes**: 54
- **Flags**: `.A.R..`  
  *(ACK and RST flags set)*

---

### Key Observations

#### 1. **Single Packet, Very Short Duration**
- Only **1 packet** was sent; the flow lasted **0.0 seconds**.
- This indicates no real session was established.

#### 2. **Flags: `.A.R..` (ACK and RST)**
- This means the packet had both the **ACK** and **RST** flags set.
- Typically, a host sends a **RST** to reset a connection—often in response to a SYN to a closed port, or after receiving unexpected traffic.

#### 3. **Unusual Destination Port**
- The **destination port** is **38148**, a high-numbered, non-standard port.
- This is not a commonly used port for any typical service.

#### 4. **Source Port: 587**
- Port 587 is used for mail submission, but in this context, it's just a source port, not directly relevant.

---

### Why is this a Port Scan?

**Port Scans** are characterized by attempts to connect to multiple ports on a host (often high, random, or sequential ports) to discover which services are running. This often involves sending probes (like SYN packets) to a target port, and the target's response determines if the port is open, closed, or filtered.

#### In this specific flow:
- The flow consists of a single TCP packet, **not establishing a real session**.
- The **high-numbered destination port** suggests the source is probing uncommon ports.
- The recipient (likely) responded with a TCP RST-ACK, which is a **common response to unsolicited or unexpected connection attempts** to a closed port.
- **No real data transfer** or session occurs; just a probe and a reset.

#### **Patterns typical of port scans:**
- Many short-duration flows, each to different ports.
- Many flows with RST responses (indicating closed ports).
- Each flow has only one or two packets, often with no payload.

---

### Why not the other categories?

- **""---"" (Normal)**: Normal flows usually involve more than one packet, session establishment, and bidirectional data.
- **""dos""**: Denial of Service attacks are characterized by high-volume, repeated traffic to the same service or host, not just a single probe.
- **""bruteForce""**: Brute-force attacks involve repeated login attempts, usually over established sessions.
- **""pingScan""**: Ping scans use ICMP, not TCP.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Feature            | Value          | PortScan Indicator?         |
|--------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Duration           | 0.0           | Yes (just a probe)          |
| Packets            | 1             | Yes (no session)            |
| Flags              | .A.R..         | Yes (RST-ACK from target)   |
| Dest Port          | 38148          | Yes (unusual, high port)    |
| Protocol           | TCP            | Typical for port scan       |

---

## **Conclusion**

This flow was classified as **""portScan""** because:
- It's a single-packet TCP connection attempt to a non-standard, high-numbered port,
- Which was met with a **RST-ACK** (indicating the port is closed),
- With no real session or data transfer,
- Which is the classic signature of a port scan probe.

If you looked at the bigger picture (all flows from this source), you'd likely see this IP probing many different ports in a similar way.

Explanation: 49

Let's analyze the given network flow and the possible reasons for its classification as a **port scan** (""portScan""):

### Flow Attributes
- **Start Time:** 2017-03-21 13:04:37.180
- **Duration:** 0.0 (very short)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source Port:** 38150
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.9
- **Destination Port:** 9944
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 58
- **Flags:** ....S. (Only the SYN flag is set)

---

## Key Points in the Classification

### 1. **Single SYN Packet**
- The only packet in this flow contains the **SYN** flag, which is used to initiate a TCP connection.
- No ACK, RST, or FIN flags, which would indicate further communication or connection termination.

### 2. **No Data Exchange**
- The **duration is 0.0 seconds**, and only **1 packet** (58 bytes) was sent. This means there was no actual established connection or significant data transfer.

### 3. **Unusual Destination Port**
- The destination port (9944) is **not a standard port** (such as 80, 443, 22, etc.), which can be a sign of probing for open or vulnerable ports.

### 4. **Typical Port Scan Behavior**
- **Port scanning** involves sending SYN packets to many different ports on a target host to see which ports are open.
- If a port is open, the server usually replies with a SYN-ACK. If closed, it replies with an RST.
- The scanner may not continue the handshake (no further packets after the SYN), as is the case here.

---

## **Why is this NOT another attack type?**

- **""---"" (Normal):** Normal traffic would usually involve a successful handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and more than one packet.
- **""dos"" (Denial of Service):** DoS usually involves high numbers of packets, multiple connection attempts, or flooding a service.
- **""bruteForce"":** Brute force attacks involve multiple login attempts, usually over established connections and with more packets/data.
- **""pingScan"":** Ping scans use ICMP, not TCP.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Feature               | Value            | PortScan Indicator?   |
|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| TCP Flags             | SYN only         | Yes                   |
| Packets               | 1                | Yes                   |
| Duration              | 0.0s             | Yes                   |
| Destination Port      | Unusual (9944)   | Yes                   |
| Protocol              | TCP              | Yes                   |

---

## **Conclusion**

This flow was classified as **""portScan""** because:
- It consists of a single TCP SYN packet with no subsequent traffic.
- The destination port is non-standard.
- The flow characteristics match the typical signature of a **TCP SYN scan**, which is a common port scanning technique used by attackers to identify open ports on a target system.

**In short:**
> **A single SYN packet to an uncommon port with no reply or further communication is a classic sign of a port scan, hence the ""portScan"" classification.**


Explanation: 50

Let's analyze the provided network flow and the likely reasoning for its **""portScan""** classification:

---

### **Flow Attributes**

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-15 14:17:18.212  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.1  
- **Source Port:** 27000  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Destination Port:** 33168  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 54  
- **TCP Flags:** .A.R.. (ACK and RST set)

---

## **Interpretation of the Flow**

### **1. Single Packet, 0.0 Duration**
- The flow consists of **only one packet** and was opened and closed instantly (duration = 0.0).
- This is unusual for a typical, legitimate TCP connection, which would generally involve more than one packet (e.g., SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK, followed by data).

### **2. TCP Flags: .A.R..**
- **A** = ACK (Acknowledgement)
- **R** = RST (Reset)
- This packet is not part of a normal connection handshake or data transfer.  
- A packet with only ACK and RST set is usually sent **in response to an unexpected or unsolicited packet** (e.g., a SYN sent to a closed port, or an ACK sent to a host with no open connection).

### **3. Possible Scenario**
- An attacker (or scanner) sends a TCP packet (often a SYN) to a port to see if it is open.
- If the port is **closed**, the target typically replies with a **RST (Reset) packet with the ACK flag set**.
- **Single-packet flows** with RST+ACK are a hallmark of port scans, where an attacker is probing many ports to see which are open or closed.

### **4. No Data Transferred**
- Only 54 bytes, which is consistent with the minimum size of a TCP control packet (headers, no data).

---

## **Reason for ""portScan"" Classification**

- **The flow shows a single TCP packet from the destination, with RST and ACK flags set, in response to a probe.**
- The presence of only one packet, with a RST-ACK combination, and no data, is indicative of a scan rather than normal communication.
- **Port scanning** tools typically sweep across many ports, eliciting these RST-ACK responses to map out which ports are closed (and which do not respond, which might be open/filtered).
- **No evidence of sustained data transfer, brute force attempts, or ICMP activity (for ping scans), nor the volume for DoS.**

---

### **Summary Table**

| Feature                   | Value           | PortScan Indicator?      |
|---------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Packets                   | 1               | Yes (probes usually single-packet) |
| TCP Flags                 | .A.R.. (ACK, RST) | Yes (response to scan)    |
| Duration                  | 0.0             | Yes (no real connection)  |
| Bytes                     | 54              | Yes (header only)         |
| Protocol                  | TCP             | Yes                      |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow is classified as ""portScan"" because its characteristics (single-packet, RST+ACK flags, no data, immediate termination) match the typical response of a host to a TCP port scan. Port scans generate many such short-lived flows as the scanner probes for open/closed ports.**

Explanation: 51

Let’s break down the network flow attributes and **explain why it was classified as a ""portScan""**:

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Start time**: 2017-03-21 03:18:28.424
- **Duration**: 0.0 (very short, essentially instantaneous)
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Src IP/port**: 192.168.220.16:33508
- **Dest IP/port**: 192.168.210.5:2007
- **Packets**: 1
- **Bytes**: 58
- **TCP Flags**: ....S. (only SYN flag set)

---

## Step-by-Step Reasoning

### 1. **Single SYN Packet**
- The **only TCP flag set is SYN** (`....S.`).
- A SYN packet is the first step in establishing a TCP connection (the ""SYN"" in the three-way handshake: SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
- **No response** (no ACK, no data transfer), just a SYN.

### 2. **No Data Exchange**
- **Only 1 packet, 58 bytes**: This is the size of a typical TCP SYN packet.
- **Duration is 0.0**: The flow was opened and closed immediately.

### 3. **Behavior Pattern**
- This pattern (single SYN, no follow-up, no data) is **typical of port scanning tools**.
    - Port scanners (like nmap, masscan, etc.) send SYNs to many ports to see which respond.
    - If the port is open, there will be a SYN-ACK back (not in this flow).
    - If closed, there’s usually a RST.
    - The scanner often doesn’t complete the handshake; it just sends SYNs.

### 4. **No Signs of Attack Traffic**
- **Not DoS**: That would involve lots of packets, often to the same port.
- **Not BruteForce**: That would involve multiple connection attempts, possibly with incorrect credentials, and more packets.
- **Not PingScan**: That would use ICMP, not TCP.

### 5. **No Normal User Behavior**
- A normal client would send a SYN, **then complete the handshake and exchange data**.
- Here, only the initial handshake attempt is made.

---

## **Conclusion: Why ""portScan""?**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**

- It consists of a **single TCP SYN packet** (the classic initial probe to check if a port is open).
- **No further communication** occurs (no handshake, no data).
- This pattern is consistent with **TCP SYN scanning**, a common technique to enumerate open ports on a host without establishing full connections.
- **Normal flows** have more packets, longer duration, and complete handshakes with data transfer.

---

### **In short:**
> **A single SYN packet to a port, with no further communication, is a strong indicator of port scanning activity.** That’s why this flow is classified as a ""portScan"".

Explanation: 52

Let's analyze the attributes of your network flow in the context of why it was classified as **""portScan""**:

---

### **Flow Attributes Recap**
- **Start time**: 2017-03-16 18:12:58.299  
- **Duration**: 0.0 seconds  
- **Protocol**: TCP  
- **Source IP**: 192.168.100.1  
- **Source port**: 2383  
- **Destination IP**: 192.168.220.16  
- **Destination port**: 53392  
- **Packets**: 1  
- **Bytes**: 54  
- **TCP Flags**: `.A.R..` (ACK, RST)

---

### **Key Points for Classification**

1. **Single Packet, Short Duration**
   - The flow lasted **0.0 seconds** and only **one packet** was sent. This suggests a very short or failed connection attempt, not a sustained communication.

2. **TCP Flags: `.A.R..`**
   - The TCP flags here are **ACK** (Acknowledgment) and **RST** (Reset).
   - A typical port scan (specifically, a *TCP ACK or RST scan*) sends packets with certain flags to probe the state of ports. If a port is closed, the target host may respond with an RST. Sometimes a scanner can send an ACK to see if a firewall will simply drop the packet or respond.

3. **Unusual Destination Port**
   - The destination port **53392** is a high, non-standard port, typical in port scan scenarios where an attacker is probing a range of ports to see which are open.

4. **Low Data Volume**
   - Only **54 bytes** were transmitted, which matches the typical size of a TCP packet without payload, further suggesting this is just a probe and not an actual data session.

---

### **Why not the other labels?**

- **Normal flow (""---"")**:  
  Legitimate connections usually have more packets, longer durations, and involve established communications, not just a single probe with RST/ACK flags.

- **DoS (""dos"")**:  
  Denial of Service attacks typically involve a flood of packets, not a single probe.

- **BruteForce (""bruteForce"")**:  
  Brute force attacks are characterized by multiple login attempts, usually with multiple packets and longer sessions.

- **PingScan (""pingScan"")**:  
  Ping scans use ICMP echo requests, not TCP packets.

---

### **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**
- The source sent a single TCP packet with unusual flags (ACK + RST) to a high, likely random destination port.
- There was no actual session established, just a probe.
- This matches the pattern of a typical port scan, where an attacker tries to discover open ports or services on a target by sending crafted packets to various ports and noting the responses.

**In summary:**  
> The flow's characteristics (single TCP ACK/RST packet to a high port, no actual data exchange, very short duration) are consistent with a port scanning technique, where the goal is to map open/closed ports rather than establish a full communication session.

Explanation: 53

Let's break down the key attributes of the provided network flow:

---

**Network Flow Details:**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-17 17:30:43.389  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Transport protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.210.1  
- **Source port:** 56737  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Destination port:** 36919  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 54  
- **TCP Flags:** .A.R.. (ACK and RST set, no SYN, FIN, PSH, or URG)

---

## Why was this classified as a ""portScan""?

### **1. Single packet, very short duration**
- The flow lasted **0.0 seconds** and consisted of **only 1 packet**.
- Normal TCP connections usually involve a handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and multiple packets.

### **2. TCP Flags: .A.R..**
- The packet has **ACK** and **RST** flags set.
- This pattern (ACK + RST) is often seen when:
  - A host responds to a connection attempt on a port where there is no listening service.
  - Or, more relevant to scans, when a scan probe elicits a response that says ""this port is closed"" (RST), and the scanning host acknowledges it (ACK).

### **3. Unusual Destination Port**
- **Destination port 36919** is a high, seemingly random port—not a typical service port (like 80, 443, or 22).
- Port scans often target a wide range of ports, including high-numbered or uncommon ones, to see which are open.

### **4. Typical Behavior of Port Scans**
- During a **TCP port scan**, an attacker sends probe packets to many different ports on a target host to determine which ones are open.
- If the scanned port is closed, the target responds with a RST (reset).
- The scanner collects these responses to map the target's open/closed ports.

### **5. No Evidence of an Ongoing Connection**
- No SYN flag, no data transfer—just a single packet.
- This is not consistent with normal user activity, but with probing/checking for port status.

## **Summary Table**

| Feature                       | Value           | PortScan Indicator?          |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Number of packets             | 1               | Yes (scan is often 1 packet) |
| Duration                      | 0.0s            | Yes                          |
| TCP flags                     | .A.R..          | Yes (RST/ACK = closed port)  |
| Destination port              | 36919           | Yes (random/high port)       |
| Protocol                      | TCP             | (Common for port scans)      |
| No established connection     | Yes             | Yes                          |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**
- It consists of a single TCP packet to a high-numbered port,
- The TCP flags (ACK + RST) indicate a port that is not open for communication,
- The flow pattern is typical of automated tools scanning many ports in rapid succession to discover open ports,
- There is no evidence of a legitimate connection attempt (no SYN, no data exchange).

All these factors together strongly suggest this flow is part of a **port scanning** activity, rather than normal operation or another type of attack.


Explanation: 54

Let's break down the flow and the likely reasoning for its classification as **""portScan""**:

### 1. **Flow Attributes Overview**
- **Source IP**: `192.168.100.3`
- **Source Port**: `1494`
- **Destination IP**: `192.168.220.16`
- **Destination Port**: `53392`
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Packets**: 1
- **Bytes**: 54
- **Duration**: 0.0 seconds
- **Flags**: `.A.R..` (ACK and RST)

---

### 2. **Key Observations**

#### **a. Single Packet, Zero Duration**
- The flow consists of a **single packet**, and the duration is **0.0 seconds**. This strongly suggests that there was no actual session or data exchange—just a single, quick interaction.

#### **b. Destination Port is Unusual**
- The destination port `53392` is **high and uncommon**. Attackers often scan a wide range of ports, including high-numbered ones, to look for open services.

#### **c. TCP Flags: `.A.R..`**
- The packet contains **ACK** (A) and **RST** (R) flags.
- Typical TCP connection establishment uses SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK. A packet with just ACK and RST is not part of normal connection establishment or teardown.
- **RST (Reset)** is often sent in response to unsolicited or unexpected packets, or when a port is closed.

#### **d. No Data Transmission**
- Only 54 bytes (likely just the TCP header, no payload).

---

### 3. **Interpretation**

#### **Why Port Scan?**
- **Port scanning** involves sending packets to a range of ports on a target system to find which ports are open.
- A common scanning method is to send SYN packets to many ports and see which ones respond.
- Sometimes, scanners send **ACK** packets to see how a firewall responds (an ""ACK scan""), or send packets to elicit a RST response from the server.
- In your flow, the presence of a single **ACK/RST** packet, no data, and a high-numbered port all point to probing activity rather than normal communication.

#### **Not DOS, BruteForce, or PingScan**
- **DOS**: Would involve many packets, often to a single or small set of ports, and typically attempts to overwhelm a service.
- **BruteForce**: Would involve repeated attempts to authenticate to a service (e.g., multiple login attempts), not just a single packet.
- **PingScan**: Uses ICMP, not TCP.

---

### 4. **Summary Table**

| Feature       | Normal Traffic | Port Scan | This Flow           |

### **Conclusion**
This flow was classified as **""portScan""** because it matches the signature of a port scan:
- a single, short-duration packet,
- targeting an uncommon/high port,
- with TCP flags (ACK/RST) not typical of normal connections,
- and no data transmitted.

**Such flows are characteristic of automated tools probing ports to discover which ones are open or closed.**


Explanation: 55

Let's break down the network flow attributes and why it was classified as **""portScan""**:

### Flow Attributes:
- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-16 14:55:49.959  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 60387  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.210.3  
- **Dest port:** 8090  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S. (SYN flag set)

---

## Key Observations

1. **Only 1 packet sent, with SYN flag:**
   - The only TCP flag set is **SYN** (....S.), which means this packet is an attempt to **initiate a TCP connection**.
   - No ACK, no data, no response—just a single connection attempt.

2. **No data transferred, flow duration 0.0:**
   - The flow is extremely short (effectively instantaneous), and no data is exchanged.
   - This matches the pattern of a ""probing"" activity, not a real data transfer.

3. **No further packets:**
   - Only 1 packet sent, with no follow-up or established session.

---

## Why **""PortScan""?**

### What is a Port Scan?
- A **port scan** is an activity where an attacker sends packets (typically SYN packets) to various ports on a target machine to determine which ports are open and listening.
- A common technique is to send a **SYN packet** (start of TCP handshake) and see which ports respond.
- If the port is closed, it doesn't respond or sends a RST.
- If the port is open, it will respond with SYN-ACK.

### How does this flow match a Port Scan?
- **Single SYN packet** to a specific port (**8090**) on a destination host, **no data transfer**, **no established connection**.
- This is the classic signature of a **port scan attempt**—the attacker is trying to see if port 8090 is open on 192.168.210.3.
- If this pattern is repeated for other ports, you would see many similar flows with different destination ports.

### Why **not** the other labels?
- **""dos"":** No evidence of flooding or repeated requests to overwhelm the service. Only 1 packet.
- **""bruteForce"":** No repeated login attempts or multiple packets targeting authentication.
- **""pingScan"":** Not ICMP/Echo packets; this is TCP SYN.
- **""---"" (Normal):** Normal connections usually have more than just a SYN; they establish a session and exchange data.

---

## **Summary:**

> **This flow was classified as a ""portScan"" because it consists of a single TCP SYN packet (attempting to initiate a connection) with no follow-up, no data exchanged, and an instantaneous duration. This is a classic pattern for port scan activity, where the attacker is probing to see if a specific port is open on the target host.**

**If you see multiple such flows from the same source IP to different destination ports, this further confirms a port scanning attempt.**


Explanation: 56

Let's analyze the network flow attributes and reasoning behind its classification as **""portScan""**.

### Flow Details Recap

| Attribute         | Value                        |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Start time        | 2017-03-17 13:25:37.414     |
| Duration          | 0.0                         |
| Protocol          | TCP                         |
| Src IP            | 192.168.100.1               |
| Src Port          | 3306                        |
| Dest IP           | 192.168.220.16              |
| Dest Port         | 61477                       |
| Packets           | 1                           |
| Bytes             | 54                          |
| TCP Flags         | .A.R..                      |

#### TCP Flags: "".A.R..""
- **A (ACK)**: Acknowledgment
- **R (RST)**: Reset

### Why is this a ""portScan""?

#### 1. **Single Packet with RST/ACK Flags**
- The flow consists of only **one packet**.
- The TCP flags are "".A.R.."", meaning **ACK** and **RST** were set.
  - This typically indicates that a TCP connection was **immediately reset** after being acknowledged, **without any data transfer** (no SYN, no established session).

#### 2. **Source/Destination Ports**
- **Source port is 3306** (commonly MySQL), but that's not the focus here.
- **Destination port is 61477**, a high, likely unused port.

#### 3. **Zero Duration, Minimal Bytes**
- The flow duration is **0.0**, and only **54 bytes** were sent, suggesting just headers (no payload).

#### 4. **Common Port Scan Behavior**
- During a **TCP port scan** (like a SYN scan or connect scan), the attacker sends probes to a range of ports on the target machine to see which are open.
- If a port is **closed**, the target often responds with **RST** (reset).
- If a port is **open**, the target responds with **SYN-ACK**.
- The presence of **only one packet, with RST/ACK, zero duration, and minimal bytes** is a textbook sign of a scan, where a connection attempt is either reset by the target or quickly abandoned.

#### 5. **No Data Transfer**
- Normal application flows involve multiple packets, data transfer, and more complex flag sequences.
- Here: **No data**, **no handshake completion**, **just a single probe and reset**.

---

## **Summary**
This flow was classified as **""portScan""** because:
- It consists of a **single TCP packet** with the **RST/ACK** flags set.
- It targets a **high, likely unused port**.
- The **duration is zero** and **no data transfer** occurs.
- This is **highly characteristic of automated port scan activity**, where the attacker sends probes to many ports and the target responds with RST/ACK for closed ports.
- Such flows are **not consistent with normal user/application activity**, but rather with reconnaissance (scanning) behavior.

### **Short explanation**:
> **A port scan is characterized by brief, single-packet flows with reset flags, minimal duration, and no data transfer, as seen here—indicating someone is probing to see if a port is open or closed.**

Explanation: 57

Great, let's analyze your network flow step by step and explain why it was classified as **""portScan""**:

**Flow Attributes Recap:**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-15 00:45:08.892  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source port:** 51357  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.2  
- **Destination port:** 1087  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S.  (SYN only)

---

## Step-by-step Explanation

### 1. **TCP SYN Packet**
- The ""Flags"" field is `....S.`, which means **only the SYN flag is set**.
- The SYN flag is used to initiate a TCP connection; a typical TCP handshake starts with a SYN packet.

### 2. **Single Packet, Zero Duration**
- Only **1 packet** was sent, and the duration is **0.0 seconds**.
- This means there was **no response** from the destination, and no further communication (no handshake completed).

### 3. **No Data Exchange**
- Only **58 bytes** were sent (the size of a TCP header with SYN, no payload).
- No data was actually transmitted; just the connection initiation attempt.

### 4. **Port and Target**
- The destination port is **1087**, not a common service port.
- Attackers performing a **port scan** often send SYN packets to different ports on a target machine to discover which ports are open.

### 5. **Pattern Detection**
- In typical network monitoring, a single SYN packet to an uncommon port, with no response or further packets, is **indicative of a port scan** (specifically, a SYN scan).
- **SYN scan** is a common port scanning technique where the attacker sends SYN packets to multiple ports and waits for SYN-ACK (open) or RST (closed) responses, without completing the handshake.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | Value         | PortScan Indicator? |
|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| TCP Flags         | SYN only     | Yes                 |
| Packets           | 1            | Yes                 |
| Duration          | 0.0          | Yes                 |
| Data transmitted  | None         | Yes                 |
| Destination Port  | Uncommon     | Yes                 |

---

## **Conclusion**
**Why is this flow considered a ""portScan""?**

- The flow consists of a single TCP SYN packet (the initial handshake step).
- No data transfer or further communication occurred (no handshake completion).
- The destination port is not a common service port.
- This pattern matches a **SYN scan** (a subtype of port scan), where an attacker probes ports with SYN packets to determine which ports are open, without establishing a full connection.

**In summary:**  
> **This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it matches the typical behavior of a SYN scan: a single TCP SYN packet is sent to probe a port, with no data exchanged and no completed connection. This is a common reconnaissance technique used by attackers to map out which ports are open on a target system.**

Explanation: 58

Let's break down the key elements of your network flow and **why it was classified as ""portScan""**:

---

### **Flow Attributes**

- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 52087  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.210.4  
- **Dest port:** 179.0  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S. (only SYN flag is set)  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Classification:** portScan

---

### **Key Points in the Flow**

1. **Single Packet, Single SYN**
   - Only **one packet** was sent.
   - The only TCP flag set is **SYN** (....S.), indicating a connection initiation attempt.

2. **No Response, No Data Transfer**
   - Duration is **0.0** (immediate, no established session).
   - No ACK, no data, no further flags.

3. **Destination Port**
   - The flow is targeting TCP **port 179** (commonly used by BGP, but that's not the main issue here).

---

### **Why is this a ""portScan""?**

A **port scan** is typically detected when a host sends SYN packets (connection attempts) to various ports on a target machine, often in quick succession, to discover which ports are open and can be connected to.

#### **Evidence of Port Scanning:**

- **SYN Packet Only:**  
  Sending only a SYN packet (without completing the handshake) is a common port scanning technique (""SYN scan""), used to probe whether a port is open.
- **No Established Connection:**  
  The flow doesn't show a completed handshake (no ACK, no data transferred), which is typical of scanning behavior rather than normal communication.
- **Short Duration:**  
  The flow lasted 0.0 seconds, indicating no actual session was established.
- **Unusual Port:**  
  Port 179 is not a common destination for normal user activity; scanning this port suggests reconnaissance.

#### **How a classifier sees this:**

Automated intrusion detection systems look for patterns like:
- Flows with a single SYN (S) flag.
- Very short duration.
- No data transfer.
- Multiple such flows to different ports/hosts (not visible in this single flow, but this flow matches the pattern).

---

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | Value           | Why it suggests port scan?                      |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Packets           | 1              | Only a probe, not a real connection             |
| Bytes             | 58             | Minimum size, no data payload                   |
| TCP Flags         | ....S.         | Only SYN, classic scan behavior                 |
| Duration          | 0.0            | No session established                          |
| Dest Port         | 179            | Unusual for normal traffic                      |

---

### **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan""** because it matches a typical SYN scan signature: a single SYN packet sent to a port, with no follow-up communication, used for discovering open ports rather than engaging in normal traffic.

---

If you saw multiple such flows to different ports or from the same source, that would further confirm a port scan!


Explanation: 59

Certainly! Let's break down the flow attributes and the reasoning for its classification as **""portScan""**:

---

### 1. **Flow Attributes Analysis**

- **Proto:** `TCP`
- **Src IP / Src port:** `192.168.220.16:45411`
- **Dest IP / Dest port:** `192.168.210.2:19283`
- **Packets:** `1`
- **Bytes:** `58`
- **Flags:** `....S.` (SYN flag only)
- **Duration:** `0.0` (very short, essentially instantaneous flow)

---

### 2. **Key Indicators in This Flow**

#### **a. SYN-only Packet**
- The TCP flag field is `....S.`, which means **only the SYN flag is set**.
- This means the source is **initiating** a connection, not responding to one or exchanging data.

#### **b. Single Packet, No Response**
- Only **one packet** was transmitted, and the flow duration is `0.0`.
- There is **no indication of a reply** from the destination (such as SYN-ACK, ACK, or RST).
- **No data exchange**; just an attempt to start a connection.

#### **c. Unusual Destination Port**
- The destination port is `19283`, which is a **high, uncommon port**.
- Scanners typically probe a range of ports, including uncommon ones, to discover open services.

---

### 3. **Why Not Other Attack Types?**

- **""dos""**: Denial of Service attacks typically involve **many packets** and/or **large volumes of traffic** designed to overwhelm a target. This flow is just a single SYN packet.
- **""bruteForce""**: Brute force attacks involve **multiple login attempts** (many packets, likely with payloads), which is not the case here.
- **""pingScan""**: Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **""---"" (Normal Flow)**: Normal connections would typically show the **SYN** followed by a **SYN-ACK** (and possibly ACK), and likely more than one packet.

---

### 4. **Why ""portScan""?**

- **Port scanning** is the act of **probing different ports** on a host to discover which are open and listening.
- A classic port scan involves sending SYN packets to various ports and **waiting for responses** (SYN-ACK for open, RST for closed).
- Here, we see a **single SYN packet** to a possibly uncommon port, **with no further communication**.
- This pattern is **typical of a scanning tool**: send a SYN, record the response (or note the lack of one), then move on to the next port.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute                                   | Value                         | PortScan Indicator?     |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| TCP SYN only                                | Yes (....S.)                  | Yes                     |
| Single packet, no response                   | Yes                           | Yes                     |
| Unusual/high destination port                | Yes (19283)                   | Yes                     |
| No data exchange                            | Yes                           | Yes                     |
| Duration                                    | 0.0 (very short)              | Yes                     |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**
- It consists of a single TCP SYN packet (indicating a connection attempt, not a full session).
- No response or further communication occurred.
- The destination port is uncommon, suggesting a probe rather than legitimate communication.
- Such behavior matches the typical pattern of a port scan, where an attacker sends SYN packets to multiple ports to identify which ones are open.

Explanation: 60

Let's break down the information in your network flow:

---

### Flow Attributes

- **Start time**: 2017-03-21 13:03:03.973
- **Duration**: 0.0 seconds
- **Proto**: TCP
- **Src IP**: 192.168.220.16
- **Src port**: 38151
- **Dest IP**: 192.168.200.8
- **Dest port**: 765
- **Packets**: 1
- **Bytes**: 58
- **Flags**: ....S. (SYN only)

---

## Why is this a ""portScan""?

### 1. **Single SYN Packet**
- The only flag set is **SYN** (....S.), which indicates the start of a TCP connection attempt.
- No ACK, FIN, RST, or data transfer is present.
- This is commonly seen when a host is probing to see if a port is open, without actually completing a connection.

### 2. **Single Packet, No Data**
- Only **1 packet** and **58 bytes** (typical size of a TCP SYN packet with no payload).
- Duration is **0.0 seconds**, further suggesting no real session was established.

### 3. **Unusual Destination Port**
- The destination port is **765**, which is not a standard or common service port.
- Port scans often target a range of ports, including uncommon ones, to discover open services.

### 4. **No Follow-up Traffic**
- After the SYN, there is no further traffic (no handshake, no data), which is typical in port scanning where the attacker is only interested in which ports respond.

### 5. **PortScan vs. Other Attack Types**
- **DoS**: Would involve many packets, often to overwhelm a service.
- **BruteForce**: Would show repeated attempts to authenticate, multiple packets, possibly data.
- **PingScan**: Would use ICMP, not TCP SYN.
- **Normal traffic**: Would show a complete handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and usually some data.
- **PortScan**: Characterized by a series of SYN packets to various ports, each with minimal packets and no established session.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Indicator         | Value    | PortScan Reasoning                    |
|-------------------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| TCP Flags         | SYN only | Probing for open port                 |
| Packet count      | 1        | No handshake, just probe              |
| Bytes             | 58       | Minimal, typical of SYN               |
| Duration          | 0.0      | No real session                       |
| Destination Port  | 765      | Uncommon, typical in scans            |

---

## **Conclusion**

This flow is classified as **""portScan""** because it consists of a single TCP SYN packet (connection attempt) to a nonstandard port, with no further communication. This is the textbook signature of a port scan, where an attacker probes a port to see if it is open, without completing a connection or sending data.

**In summary:**  
> The flow matches port scan behavior: a single SYN is sent to a port, with no traffic afterward, which is how attackers scan for open ports on a target system.


Explanation: 61

Let's analyze the provided network flow attributes and the **reasoning** for its classification as a **""portScan""**:

---

### **Flow Attributes Recap**

- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-15 17:41:58.983  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.210.1  
- **Src port:** 2000  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Dest port:** 45411.0  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 54  
- **Flags:** .A.R..  

---

## **Key Points in the Flow**

1. **TCP Flags: `.A.R..`**
   - **A (ACK)** and **R (RST)** are set.  
   - **SYN** is **not** set.
   - This means this is an **ACK+RST** packet.

2. **Single Packet, 0.0 seconds Duration**
   - Only one packet sent, instantly.

3. **Source and Destination**
   - Source: 192.168.210.1:2000
   - Destination: 192.168.220.16:45411

---

## **What is a Port Scan?**

- **Port scanning** involves probing a host with packets to determine which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
- The most common type is a SYN scan, but there are others: ACK scan, FIN scan, NULL scan, etc.

---

## **Why is this a Port Scan?**

### **1. Use of Unusual TCP Flags (ACK + RST)**
- Sending packets with only **ACK** or **ACK+RST** is a known port scanning technique (e.g., ""ACK scan"").
- Attackers use ACK scans to bypass certain firewalls and determine if ports are filtered or unfiltered.

### **2. Single Packet Per Port**
- A normal connection would start with a SYN, possibly followed by an ACK, then data packets.
- Here, only a single packet is sent, and it is not part of a normal TCP handshake.

### **3. High Destination Port**
- The destination port (45411) is high and seemingly random, as is typical in port scan activity (scanning many ports).

### **4. No Data Exchange, Just a Probe**
- No session established, no data exchanged—just a probe and reset.

---

## **Summary:**

- **The flow shows a single TCP packet with ACK and RST flags sent to a high-numbered port.**
- **This pattern matches the signature of a TCP ACK scan, which is a type of port scan.**
- **There is no indication of multiple packets or a completed handshake (as would be seen in brute force or DoS), nor is it an ICMP packet (which would be a ping scan).**
- **Normal flows do not typically consist of single ACK+RST packets to random ports.**

---

### **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it matches the pattern of a TCP ACK scan: a single TCP packet with the ACK and RST flags set, sent to a potentially random port, with no attempt to establish a connection. Attackers use this technique to map firewall rules and discover open or filtered ports.**

Explanation: 62

Certainly! Let's analyze the attributes of your network flow and explain why it was classified as **""portScan""**.

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Date first seen**: 2017-03-16 13:46:57.771
- **Duration**: 0.0 seconds
- **Proto**: TCP
- **Src IP**: 192.168.220.16
- **Src port**: 47082
- **Dest IP**: 192.168.210.5
- **Dest port**: 1083.0
- **Packets**: 1
- **Bytes**: 58
- **Flags**: ....S.

### Key Indicators for Classification

Let's break down the important clues:

#### 1. **TCP SYN Flag Only (`....S.`):**
- The only flag set is **SYN** (`S`), which is the initial flag used to start a TCP connection (the first step in the TCP three-way handshake).
- There are **no ACK, FIN, RST, or other flags** present.

#### 2. **Single Packet, Small Size:**
- Only **1 packet** was sent.
- The flow's **duration is 0.0 seconds**; it was extremely short-lived.
- Only **58 bytes** transmitted, which matches the size of a standard TCP SYN packet.

#### 3. **No Established Connection:**
- Since only a SYN packet was sent (and no further packets or flags like ACK or FIN), the connection was never established.
- This is typical when a host is probing a port to see if it is open, **but not actually trying to communicate**.

#### 4. **Port Number:**
- The **destination port** (1083) is a high, non-standard port, possibly one of many being probed in succession.

### Why is This a ""portScan""?

A **port scan** is an activity where an attacker (or automated tool) sends packets (often SYN packets) to a range of ports on a target system to discover which ports are open and listening for connections.

- **Typical Signature:** SYN packets sent to various ports, with no follow-up communication if the port is open or closed.
- **Goal:** To enumerate open services for possible exploitation or further attack.

#### In your flow:
- The source IP is sending a **single SYN packet** to a possibly random or sequential port on the destination, **without trying to establish a full connection**.
- This behavior matches a **port scan**, especially a **SYN scan** (also known as ""half-open"" scan), which is very common for reconnaissance.

#### Why not other labels?
- **""dos""**: Involves flooding with multiple packets or connections, not a single SYN.
- **""bruteForce""**: Would show repeated login attempts, not just SYN packets.
- **""pingScan""**: Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **""---"" (Normal)**: Normal connections proceed through the handshake (SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK), not just a SYN packet.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute            | Value                | Relevance to PortScan              |
|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| TCP SYN only         | ....S.               | Typical of SYN scanning            |
| 1 packet, 0.0 sec    |                      | Probing, not connection            |
| Small packet (58 B)  |                      | SYN packet size                    |
| No full handshake    |                      | Not a normal connection            |
| Unusual destination port | 1083.0           | Scanning for open ports            |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow is classified as ""portScan"" because it consists of a single TCP SYN packet sent to a destination port, with no follow-up packets, which is a classic signature of SYN-based port scanning activity.**

If you see many such flows from the same source IP to different destination ports or hosts, it's a clear sign of reconnaissance in the form of a port scan.


Explanation: 63

Let's analyze the flow attributes and why it was classified as **""portScan""**:

### Flow Attributes
- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-21 13:03:15.075
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source port:** 38149
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Destination port:** 9877
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 58
- **Flags:** ....S. (Only SYN flag set)

---

### Key Observations

#### 1. **Single Packet, SYN Only**
- The TCP Flags value is **....S.**:
  - This means only the **SYN** flag is set. (No ACK, PSH, RST, URG, or FIN)
- This is characteristic of the **very first packet** in a TCP handshake: a connection attempt.

#### 2. **Duration and Packet Count**
- **Duration:** 0.0 (instantaneous, no further packets)
- **Packets:** Only **1** packet was sent (no replies, no further communication).

#### 3. **No Established Connection**
- There is no evidence of a completed handshake (no SYN-ACK, no ACK).
- Just a SYN packet is sent—no actual data transfer, no follow-up.

#### 4. **Potential Attack Patterns**
- **Port scanning** is commonly performed by sending **SYN packets** to different ports or hosts to discover which ports are open (respond with SYN-ACK).
- In this case, the flow is just a single SYN packet to port 9877. This is consistent with a port scan, as attackers often send SYNs to many ports, but each flow is just a single SYN with no further packets.

---

### Why not another attack type?

- **Normal flow (`---`)**: Usually involves more than just a single SYN packet; at least some handshake or data transfer.
- **DoS:** Would involve many packets, usually to the same port, and generally much more traffic.
- **BruteForce:** Implies repeated login attempts, which would be reflected in multiple packets, possibly with data.
- **PingScan:** Would use ICMP protocol, not TCP.

---

### **Conclusion: Why ""portScan""?**

> **A single SYN packet to a destination port, with no further communication, is the classic signature for a port scan (specifically a TCP SYN scan).**  
> Attackers send such packets to probe which ports are open, without completing the handshake. This minimizes their footprint and avoids establishing a real connection.

**That is why this flow was classified as ""portScan"":**
- **Single SYN-only packet**
- **No follow-up or completed connection**
- **Consistent with TCP SYN scan technique used for port scanning**

Explanation: 64

Let's break down the given network flow attributes and understand **why it was classified as a ""portScan""**:

---

### Flow Attributes Recap

- **Start time:** 2017-03-15 14:20:28.091  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.2  
- **Source port:** 541  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Destination port:** 33168  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 54  
- **Flags:** .A.R.. (ACK and RST set)

---

### Key Points for ""portScan"" Classification

#### 1. **Single Packet, Single Byte Count**
- The flow consists of only **one packet** with **54 bytes**.  
- This is typical of probing/scanning activity, not of normal traffic or attacks that require multiple packets (like brute force or DoS).

#### 2. **TCP Flags: .A.R.. (ACK, RST)**
- The packet has **ACK** and **RST** flags set.
    - This is characteristic of a **TCP RST response**, usually sent in reply to a ""probe"" packet.
    - A common scanning technique is to send a TCP packet to a port to see how the target responds.
    - For example, a port scanner may send a SYN or other type of probe, and if the port is closed, the target system may reply with RST (reset).

#### 3. **Unusual Port Numbers**
- The source port is **541** and the destination port is **33168**, both of which are high and non-standard.
    - Port scans typically target a **range of ports**, many of which are uncommon, to discover open services.
    - This is in contrast to brute force attacks, which usually target standard service ports (e.g., 22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP).

#### 4. **Zero Duration**
- The duration is **0.0 seconds**, indicating the connection was not established, but rather a single exchange took place.
    - This is what you’d expect from a scan: a quick probe, then done.

#### 5. **No Evidence of DoS or Brute Force**
- **DoS attacks** involve large numbers of packets and/or bytes to overwhelm a service.
- **Brute force** involves repeated login attempts, which would show as multiple packets and likely repeated flows to the same service port.
- **Ping scans** would use ICMP, not TCP.

---

### **Summary**

This flow shows a **single TCP packet** with only **ACK and RST flags**, to an **unusual high port**, with **no data exchange** and **no connection established**. This matches the signature of **port scanning**, where an attacker probes many ports in rapid succession to see which ones are open (and which ones respond, and how).

**In short:**  
> **It was classified as ""portScan"" because it represents a single, short-lived TCP probe to an uncommon port, which is typical behavior for port scanning activity. The presence of only an RST/ACK response, no established session, and non-standard ports all support this classification.**

**If you need details on how port scans typically look in logs/flows, or want to compare with other attack types, let me know!**


Explanation: 65

Let's break down the network flow attributes and reasoning for its classification as **""portScan""**:

---

### Flow Attributes

- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-21 14:32:36.402  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.210.1  
- **Src port:** 256  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Dest port:** 52149  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 54  
- **Flags:** `.A.R..` (ACK and RST set)

---

### Key Points for Classification

#### 1. **Single Packet, Very Short Duration**
- **Only 1 packet** was sent, with a **duration of 0.0 seconds**.
- This suggests no ongoing conversation or established session.

#### 2. **TCP Flags: .A.R..**
- This means the **ACK** and **RST** flags are set.
- This is a typical response from a host **when it receives a packet for a port that is closed or unexpected**, especially if it didn't initiate a connection.

#### 3. **Unusual Destination Port**
- The destination port is very high (**52149**), which is not a standard service port.
- Port scans often target a range of ports, including high-numbered, likely unused ones, to see which are open.

#### 4. **No Attack Pattern for Other Labels**
- **Not ""dos""**: Not enough packets/bytes to be a denial of service.
- **Not ""bruteForce""**: No evidence of repeated login attempts.
- **Not ""pingScan""**: Not ICMP protocol.
- **Not ""---"" (Normal)**: The pattern is not typical for legitimate traffic (no data transfer, just a single packet with RST/ACK).

---

### **Why ""portScan""?**

A **port scan** is an activity where an attacker probes different ports on a target system to see which ones are open (accepting connections) or closed. This is often an early step in reconnaissance before an attack.

In your flow:
- The **single packet with RST/ACK** indicates a connection attempt to a port that was likely closed, and the target replied with RST/ACK to refuse the connection.
- The **combination of a high-numbered port, a single packet, and a RST/ACK response** is classic of automated port scanning tools. Scanners send SYN packets (not seen here, but the RST/ACK response is typical of a system replying to a SYN on a closed port).
- **No actual communication or data transfer** took place.

**Therefore:**  
The flow's characteristics (high port, single packet, RST/ACK, no session) strongly match the signature of a **port scan**, where the attacker is mapping out which ports are open/closed on a host.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | Value             | PortScan Relevance                                    |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Packets           | 1                 | Probing, not real communication                       |
| Duration          | 0.0               | Instantaneous, not session-based                      |
| Flags             | .A.R.. (ACK, RST) | Response to an unsolicited/failed connection attempt  |
| Dest port         | 52149             | High/likely unused port, typical scan target          |
| Bytes             | 54                | Minimal data, just packet header                     |

---

### **Conclusion**
The flow is classified as **""portScan""** because it matches the typical pattern of a scan: a connection attempt to a high, possibly unused port, met with a RST/ACK response, with no actual data exchanged, and only a single packet involved. This is not normal user behavior and is highly indicative of reconnaissance activity.


Explanation: 66

Let's break down the flow attributes you provided and why it likely was classified as **""portScan""**:

### Flow Attributes

- **Start time**: 2017-03-16 16:57:23.414  
- **Duration**: 0.0 (instantaneous; no ongoing communication)
- **Protocol**: TCP  
- **Source IP**: 192.168.100.2  
- **Source port**: 901  
- **Destination IP**: 192.168.220.16  
- **Destination port**: 53392  
- **Packets**: 1  
- **Bytes**: 54  
- **Flags**: `.A.R..` (ACK, RST set)

---

### Key Points for Classification

#### 1. **Single Packet, No Data Exchange**
- **Only 1 packet** was sent, with a **duration of 0.0** seconds.
- This suggests there was no real session established, just a single interaction.

#### 2. **TCP Flags: `.A.R..` (ACK, RST)**
- The packet had the ACK and RST (reset) flags set.
- This pattern is often seen when a host responds to an unexpected or unsolicited packet, such as a probe.

#### 3. **High, Unusual Destination Port (53392)**
- The destination port is a high number, uncommon for legitimate services, which often indicates a scan or probe looking for open ports.

#### 4. **Source Port: 901**
- Source port is also not a well-known service port, possibly chosen at random by a scanner.

#### 5. **Context: No Ongoing Exchange**
- Normal TCP communication would involve a handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), or at least a few packets.
- Here, the flow consists of just one packet, and the flags suggest a reset (connection closed or refused) rather than normal communication.

#### 6. **Common PortScan Behavior**
- **Port scans** involve probing multiple ports (often high-numbered or unusual ones) with connection attempts to see which ones are open.
- The “.A.R..” (ACK, RST) flag combination is typical when a host responds to a probe on a port that is closed, by immediately sending a reset.

---

### **Why Classified as ""portScan"":**

- **The flow matches the pattern of a port scan:** A single connection attempt to a high, likely unused port, resulting in a reset response.
- **No real data transmitted; only 1 packet, no session.**
- **TCP flags (RST)** match typical responses to port scan probes.
- **Timing and size** (instantaneous, 54 bytes) are consistent with scan packets, rather than legitimate sessions.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | Value          | Indicates PortScan?         |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Packets           | 1             | Yes (scan probes are single packets) |
| Duration          | 0.0           | Yes (no session)            |
| Flags             | .A.R..        | Yes (reset, typical of closed port probe) |
| Dest Port         | 53392         | Yes (high/odd port, typical of scanning) |
| Bytes             | 54            | Yes (very small, just header/probe)      |

---

### **Conclusion**

This flow was classified as **""portScan""** because it has all the hallmarks of a port scanning activity: a single, short-lived connection attempt to a high-numbered port, with a reset response, and no real data exchanged. This is consistent with an automated tool probing to see if a port is open, which is a common technique in reconnaissance phases of cyber attacks.  

**If you see many similar flows from the same source to different destination ports, that would further confirm scanning activity.**


Explanation: 67

Let's break down the network flow attributes and explain why it was classified as **""portScan""**:

### **Flow Attributes:**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 12:03:48.618
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source port:** 50150
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.100.1
- **Destination port:** 52673.0
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 58
- **Flags:** ....S.

### **Key Points:**

1. **Single Packet, SYN Flag Only:**
   - The TCP Flags are `....S.`, which means only the **SYN** (synchronize) flag is set.
   - A TCP connection is initiated with a SYN packet; if a full connection were established, you would see a 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
   - Only one packet was sent, with no response or further communication (duration is 0, packets = 1).

2. **Unusual Destination Port:**
   - The destination port is **52673**, a high, likely non-standard port.
   - Port scans typically probe unusual or high-numbered ports to discover open or vulnerable services.

3. **PortScan Behavior:**
   - **Port scanning** involves sending packets (often SYN) to a range of ports on a target to see which ones are open and accepting connections.
   - A classic sign of a port scan is a large number of SYN packets, each to different ports, with little or no follow-up communication (no full connections).

4. **Distinguishing from Other Attacks:**
   - **DoS (Denial of Service):** Would involve many packets or a flood of traffic, not a single SYN.
   - **BruteForce:** Would involve repeated login attempts, not a single SYN.
   - **PingScan:** Would use ICMP, not TCP.
   - **Normal:** A normal flow would usually involve more than just a single SYN, especially if a legitimate connection was attempted.

---

## **Summary Explanation:**

> **This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it consists of a single TCP SYN packet (no data, no handshake) to a high, uncommon port, which is a common pattern for port scans. Port scans use SYN packets to probe multiple ports to check which are open, without completing the connection. There is no further communication, data transfer, or responses, which is typical of a scanning attempt rather than normal traffic or other types of attacks.**

**In short:**  
*Single SYN packet to a high port, no connection established, matches typical port scan activity.*


Explanation: 68

Let's **analyze the flow attributes** and the label ""portScan"":

---
**Flow attributes summary:**
- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-21 09:14:49.834  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.210.2  
- **Source port:** 7921  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Destination port:** 33508  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 54  
- **Flags:** .A.R.. (ACK and RST set)

---

## **Explanation for 'portScan' Classification**

### **Key Indicators:**

1. **Single Packet, Zero Duration, and Small Size:**
   - The flow consists of **only 1 packet**, **0.0 duration**, and a very small size (**54 bytes**).
   - This is typical of scan activity, where the attacker sends only a single probe to see if a port is open.

2. **TCP Flags: .A.R..**
   - **ACK** (Acknowledgement) and **RST** (Reset) flags are set.
   - A **RST/ACK** packet often occurs as a response from a host when it receives a probe to a closed port, or as part of scanning techniques to detect listening services.

3. **Unusual Destination Port:**
   - The destination port (**33508**) is high and uncommon, suggesting the goal is to check for any open response, not to connect to a well-known service.

4. **No Session Established:**
   - There is **no completed TCP handshake** (no SYN or SYN/ACK), indicating this is not regular traffic.

### **Port Scanning Behavior**

- **Port scanning** is an activity where a machine systematically sends packets to a range of ports on another computer to discover which ones are open and listening.
- Attackers often use **TCP RST** and **ACK** packets in scans (e.g., **ACK scan**, **RST scan**, **FIN scan**) to map firewall rules or to identify live hosts without completing the handshake.

### **Why Not Other Attacks?**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Would typically involve multiple packets, longer durations, and large amounts of traffic.
- **BruteForce:** Would involve multiple connection attempts (often with many SYN packets), not just a single packet.
- **Ping Scan:** Uses ICMP, but this is TCP.
- **Normal traffic:** Would involve a completed handshake and more than one packet.

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**
- It shows the signature of a single, small TCP packet with the RST and ACK flags set, sent to an uncommon port, with no session establishment or data transfer.  
- This matches the pattern of a TCP port scan, where the attacker is probing to see if the port responds, often as part of an enumeration or reconnaissance phase of an attack.

---

**In summary:**  
_The flow's characteristics—single TCP packet, RST/ACK flags, short duration, uncommon port—match those generated by port scanning tools or scripts, which explains why it was classified as ""portScan""._


Explanation: 69

Certainly! Let’s break down the attributes of your flow and why it was classified as **""portScan""**:

---

### **Flow Attributes Recap**
- **Start Time:** 2017-03-15 08:41:02.907
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source Port:** 51358
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.8
- **Destination Port:** 10004
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 58
- **TCP Flags:** ....S. (SYN only)

---

### **Key Points of the Flow**

#### 1. **Single Packet, SYN Only**
- The only TCP flag set is **SYN** (....S.), which means this flow consists exclusively of a SYN packet — the first step in the TCP handshake.
- There are **no ACK, FIN, RST, or other flag bits set**.
- **Duration is zero**, suggesting the flow did not progress beyond the initial SYN packet (no handshake completed).

#### 2. **Single Packet, Single Byte Count**
- Only **1 packet** and **58 bytes** (which fits the size of a typical TCP SYN packet).

#### 3. **Uncommon Destination Port**
- The destination port is **10004**, which is not a common service port (like HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, etc.). Port scans often target a range of ports, including uncommon or high-numbered ports, to probe for open services.

#### 4. **What is a Port Scan?**
- In a **port scan**, an attacker (or scanner) sends probe packets (usually SYN packets) to many different ports on a target host to see which ports are open and accepting connections.
- Typically, these probes are SYN packets without following through the handshake, or sometimes without expecting a reply (the scanner just notes which ports respond).

---

### **Why is this flow classified as ""portScan""?**

- **Pattern:** The described flow matches the classic signature of a port scan probe:
  - **One SYN packet** to a (possibly arbitrary) port,
  - **No further communication** (no handshake completed),
  - **No data transfer**,
  - **Unusual/different destination port**.

- **Statistical/Behavioral Basis:** 
  - If you see **many such flows** from the same source IP to different destination ports on the same target (or across many targets), this is a typical port scanning behavior.
  - Even a single such flow can be flagged if part of a larger pattern, or if the system is conservative in labeling.

- **Why not another label?**
  - **Not ""dos""**: No flooding of packets or high traffic volume.
  - **Not ""bruteForce""**: No repeated login attempts or sustained connections.
  - **Not ""pingScan""**: Not using ICMP (ping), but rather TCP SYN.
  - **Not ""---"" (normal)**: Legitimate connections usually involve more than just a SYN packet and complete the handshake.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute          | Value             | PortScan Indicator?                      |
|--------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Protocol           | TCP               | Common for port scans                    |
| TCP Flags          | ....S. (SYN only) | Typical for scan probes                  |
| Packets            | 1                 | Typical for scan probes                  |
| Duration           | 0.0               | No handshake completed                   |
| Dest Port          | 10004             | Unusual port, likely being probed        |
| Bytes              | 58                | Minimal, fits a SYN packet               |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**
- It is a single SYN packet to a potentially arbitrary port, with no further communication, which is the hallmark of a TCP SYN port scan. Port scans are reconnaissance activities where an attacker seeks to discover open ports/services on a target system, and this flow fits that pattern exactly.

---

**If you have further attributes or see many such flows from the same source, the evidence for a port scan becomes even stronger.**


Explanation: 70

Let's break down the flow attributes and explain why it was classified as **""portScan""**:

### **Flow Attributes**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-17 16:21:09.623  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source port:** 33536  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.210.5  
- **Destination port:** 9050  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S. (Only SYN flag is set)

---

## **Explanation**

### **Key Observations**
1. **Only 1 packet was sent** (Packets: 1, Bytes: 58)
2. **Flow duration is 0.0 seconds** (very short, essentially instantaneous)
3. **TCP Flags: '....S.'** (SYN flag only)
   - This means this packet is a TCP SYN packet, which is the initial packet for establishing a TCP connection.
4. **No data or response** (no ACK, no further packets)

### **Why is this a Port Scan?**
A **port scan** is a technique used by attackers (or network admins) to discover open ports on a target host. The most common scanning method is the **SYN scan** (sometimes called ""half-open"" scan):

- **How it works:**  
  The scanner sends a TCP SYN packet to a target port. If the port is open, the target replies with a SYN-ACK. If it is closed, it replies with a RST. The scanner typically does not complete the handshake (does not send ACK), so the connection is never fully established.
- **What you see in logs/flows:**  
  - Many short flows with just a single SYN packet.
  - No data transfer.
  - Short duration.
  - Many different destination ports (if you look at all flows from the same source).

### **In this flow:**
- Only a single SYN packet was sent from 192.168.220.16 to 192.168.210.5:9050.
- No evidence of a full connection (no ACK, no further packets).
- No data transfer.
- The very short flow duration (0.0), indicating it was just a probe, not an actual connection.

**This pattern is typical of port scanning activity.**  
- It is likely part of an automated scan, where the source sends single SYN packets to many destination ports to see which are open.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute    | Typical Port Scan Behavior | This Flow |
|--------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| SYN only     | Yes                       | Yes       |
| 1 packet     | Yes                       | Yes       |
| 0 duration   | Yes                       | Yes       |
| No data      | Yes                       | Yes       |

## **Conclusion**

> **This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it matches the classic signature of a SYN scan: a single TCP SYN packet sent to a specific port, with no follow-up packets, no data, and a near-zero duration. This is a common technique used to probe for open ports without establishing a full connection.**

If you have multiple such flows from the same source to different destination ports or hosts, it further strengthens the port scanning evidence.


Explanation: 71

Let's break down the provided network flow and its context:

### Flow Details

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-21 13:04:40.013  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source Port:** 38148  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.200.1  
- **Destination Port:** 5440  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **TCP Flags:** ....S.

### Analysis

**1. TCP Flags:**  
The flags field is `....S.`, which means only the **SYN** flag is set.  
- This indicates the packet is trying to **initiate a new TCP connection**.

**2. Packet and Byte Count:**  
- **Only 1 packet** was sent, containing **58 bytes**.  
- This is typical for a lone TCP SYN packet, as no data payload is being sent, just the initial handshake attempt.

**3. Flow Duration:**  
- The **duration is 0.0** seconds, meaning the connection was not established or was immediately closed after the SYN.

**4. No ACK/Response:**  
- There is **no ACK**, **no data transfer**, and **no follow-up packets**.  
- This is consistent with a **connection attempt that did not succeed**, or the intent was not to establish a real connection.

### Why is this a Port Scan?

A **port scan** is an activity where an attacker or a tool sends connection attempts (usually SYN packets) to a range of ports on a target machine, to discover which ports are open and accepting connections.

#### This flow matches characteristics of a port scan:
- **SYN Scan:** The most common type of port scan is the TCP SYN scan (""half-open scan""). The scanner sends a SYN packet and waits for a response. If the port is open, the target usually replies with SYN-ACK. The scanner may not complete the handshake (i.e., not send ACK back), which is why only a single SYN packet might be logged.
- **Single SYN Packet:** A single SYN packet to a rarely-used port (like 5440) with no further communication or data is a strong indicator of a scan, rather than a legitimate connection.
- **No Data Exchange:** Legitimate connections typically involve at least a handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), possibly followed by data transfer. Here, only SYN is seen.
- **Unusual Destination Port:** Port 5440 is not a common port for standard services, making it more likely to be probed as part of a scan rather than a legitimate session.

### Why **not** the other labels?

- **""---"" (Normal):** Normal traffic usually has more than just an initial SYN; it includes completed handshakes and data transfer.
- **""dos"" (Denial of Service):** DoS attacks usually involve many packets to overwhelm a service, not single SYN packets.
- **""bruteForce"":** Brute force attacks involve repeated connection attempts to the same service (often login attempts), not isolated SYNs to random ports.
- **""pingScan"":** Ping scans use ICMP Echo Requests, not TCP SYN packets.

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as a ""portScan"" because:**

- It consists of a single TCP SYN packet (no handshake, no ACK),  
- Sent to a (possibly uncommon) port,  
- With no further interaction,  
- **Matching the signature of a port scan attempt, specifically a SYN scan, where the attacker is probing to see if the port is open.**

**In summary:**  
> The presence of a lone SYN packet to a specific port, without subsequent communication, is a classic indicator of a port scan, which is why this flow was classified as ""portScan"".


Explanation: 72

Let's break down **why this network flow was classified as a ""portScan"":**

### **Flow Attributes:**
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP/Port:** 192.168.210.1:1580
- **Destination IP/Port:** 192.168.220.16:45411
- **Start time:** 2017-03-16 02:54:50.114
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 54
- **TCP Flags:** `.A.R..` (ACK and RST set)

---

### **Key Observations:**

1. **Single Packet, No Established Session:**  
   - Only **one packet** was sent in this flow, with **no continuation** (duration 0, packets 1).
   - This often occurs in network scans where the scanner is probing for open ports and not intending to establish a full connection.

2. **TCP Flags:**  
   - **`.A.R..`**: Both **ACK** and **RST** are set.
   - This flag combination is typically seen in responses to unsolicited or unexpected packets. For example, a common port scan method sends SYN packets to various ports, and hosts respond with RST+ACK if the port is closed.

3. **Source and Destination Ports:**  
   - The **destination port** is a high, likely random port (45411), which is typical for scans trying to enumerate open ports.

---

### **Why ""portScan""?**

- **Port scans** work by sending packets to various ports on a target system to see which ones respond, helping the attacker map open/closed ports.
- The flow you provided matches the **signature of a port scan**:
  - **Short, one-packet flow** (not a real connection attempt)
  - **Unusual port** (not a standard service)
  - **RST+ACK flag** (host's response to a probe, indicating the port is closed)
- **Not a DoS**: Not enough traffic/packets/bytes for a denial of service.
- **Not brute force**: No repeated authentication attempts.
- **Not ping scan**: This is TCP, not ICMP.

### **Summary Table**

| Label        | Why not?                                                 |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| ---          | Not a normal flow; RST+ACK on a high port is suspicious  |
| dos          | Not enough traffic, duration, or repeated attempts       |
| portScan     | ✓ Matches scanning profile: single packet, RST+ACK, high port |
| bruteForce   | No evidence of authentication attempts                   |
| pingScan     | Not ICMP, no echo requests                               |

---

## **Conclusion**
**This flow is classified as ""portScan""** because it matches the typical pattern of port scan activity: a single TCP packet to a high-numbered port, with a RST+ACK flag indicating the response to a probe, rather than a legitimate connection attempt. This is consistent with reconnaissance activity rather than normal or attack traffic of other types.


Explanation: 73

Certainly! Let's break down the network flow attributes and explain **why it was classified as a ""portScan"":**

---

### **Flow Details Recap:**

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-15 10:19:10.603
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source Port:** 46755
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.210.2
- **Destination Port:** 554.0
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 58
- **Flags:** ....S. (Only SYN flag is set)

---

### **Interpretation of the Flow**

#### **1. TCP SYN Packet**
- The Flags field is `....S.`, which means **only the SYN flag is set**.
- This indicates that the flow contains a **single SYN packet** (the start of a connection attempt).

#### **2. Only One Packet, No Duration**
- **Packets:** 1
- **Duration:** 0.0 (no reply; no established connection)
- **Bytes:** 58 (typical size for a SYN packet with minimal options)

#### **3. Unusual Destination Port**
- The destination port is **554**, which is commonly used for RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol), but that detail is less important than the general pattern.

#### **4. No Response**
- Since there is only a SYN packet and no further packets (no SYN-ACK or ACK or data packets), it strongly suggests that this is just a probe.

---

### **Why This Suggests a Port Scan**

**Port scans** are reconnaissance activities where an attacker sends probe packets (typically SYN packets) to a range of ports on a target machine to see which ones are open and accepting connections.

- **A single SYN packet** to a port with no follow-up indicates a scan, not a genuine connection attempt.
- **No established session:** If a real connection was attempted, you would see more packets (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, and perhaps data).
- **High source port (ephemeral):** Often used in scans and automated tools.
- **Duration is 0.0:** No handshake or data transfer.
- **PortScan tools** like Nmap typically generate flows like this: one SYN packet to each target port, waiting for a response.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Feature         | Observation                    | PortScan Characteristic? |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| TCP Flags       | Only SYN                      | Yes                      |
| Packets         | 1                             | Yes                      |
| Duration        | 0.0                           | Yes                      |
| No Data         | No data transfer              | Yes                      |
| Destination     | Arbitrary port                | Yes                      |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**

- It consists of a single SYN packet (connection attempt) with no response.
- There is no established session or data transfer.
- This pattern matches the typical behavior of a port scan, where an attacker probes a port to check if it is open, without intending to complete the connection.

**In short:**  
**A single SYN packet to a port, with no reply and no further packets, is the classic signature of a port scan.**  
That's why this flow is classified as ""portScan"".


Explanation: 74

Let's analyze the **network flow** you provided and the likely reasoning behind its classification as **""portScan""**:

---

### **Flow Attributes**

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-20 12:03:55.202  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.100.6  
- **Source Port:** 5952  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Destination Port:** 50150  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 54  
- **TCP Flags:** `.A.R..` (ACK, RST set)

---

## **Step-by-Step Reasoning**

### 1. **TCP Flag Analysis**

- **Flags:** `.A.R..`  
  This means **ACK** and **RST** are set.
- This flag combination is typical of a **response** to a connection attempt, often seen when a host receives a TCP packet to a port where no service is listening.  
  - For example, if a SYN packet is sent to a closed port, the target replies with an RST (and possibly ACK) indicating ""no service here"".

### 2. **Duration and Packet Count**

- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 54  
  This suggests an extremely short-lived ""flow"", likely a single packet exchange.

### 3. **Source and Destination**

- **Source IP:** 192.168.100.6  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Destination Port:** 50150 (high, ephemeral port — uncommon for typical services)

### 4. **Behavioral Pattern**

- Flows with a **single packet**, **zero duration**, and **unusual destination ports** are often indicative of **scanning activity**:
  - **Port scans** work by systematically sending packets to various ports on a target to discover which are open.
  - When scanning, an attacker might send SYN packets to a range of ports. If the port is closed, the target responds (per RFC 793) with **RST/ACK**. The scanner (or the monitoring device) records this response.

### 5. **Why not other labels?**

- **Denial of Service (dos):** Typically involves many packets/bytes, sometimes to common service ports, and attempts to overwhelm.
- **BruteForce:** Implies repeated login attempts, usually to services like SSH, FTP, etc., and would involve more packets and data.
- **PingScan:** Would be ICMP, not TCP.
- **No attack:** This specific pattern (single TCP flow, high port, RST/ACK response) matches common port scan signatures, not normal user behavior.

---

## **Summary**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**

- It consists of a single TCP packet to an uncommon, high-numbered destination port.
- The response from the destination is an RST/ACK, indicating the port is closed and that some host is probing it.
- The short duration and single packet are typical of port scanning, where the attacker is ""knocking"" on many ports to see which ones are open.
- The pattern matches known port scanning signatures and not normal or other specific attack types.

---

### **In one sentence:**

> **The flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it represents a single probe to a high-numbered port resulting in a TCP RST/ACK response, which is a classic indicator of port scanning activity.**


Explanation: 75

Let's break down the information you provided and explain **why this network flow was classified as a ""portScan""**.

### Flow Attributes Breakdown

- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 09:04:28.248
- **Duration:** 0.0 (very short, essentially instantaneous)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source port:** 41422
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.1
- **Destination port:** 1165
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 58
- **Flags:** ....S. (Only SYN flag is set)

---

## Analysis

### 1. **TCP SYN Packet**

- The only TCP flag set is **SYN** (`....S.`), which means this is an **attempt to initiate a TCP connection**.
- No ACK, no data, no other flags.

### 2. **Single Packet, Single Attempt**

- Only **one packet** was sent (Packets: 1).
- **No response** (Duration: 0.0), and no further packets in this flow.

### 3. **No Data Transferred**

- **Bytes:** 58 (just enough for TCP/IP headers, no application data).

### 4. **Unusual Destination Port**

- Port **1165** is not commonly used and appears arbitrary. Attack tools often probe random or sequential ports.

### 5. **Behavior Pattern**

- Sending a single SYN packet to a port without following up is **typical of port scanning tools** (like Nmap in SYN scan mode).
- The attacker/investigator is trying to determine which ports are open by sending SYN packets. If a SYN-ACK comes back, the port is open; if an RST or nothing, it's closed or filtered.

---

## Why Not Other Attack Types?

- **""---"" (Normal flow):** Normal connections usually have more than one packet, involve completing the handshake, and transfer data. This flow is just a SYN probe.
- **""dos"" (Denial of Service):** DOS attacks involve a high volume of traffic, often to one port. Here, it's only a single packet.
- **""bruteForce"":** Bruteforce attacks involve multiple repeated attempts to authenticate (e.g., many login attempts), which is not the case here.
- **""pingScan"":** Ping scans use ICMP Echo Requests, not TCP SYN packets.

---

## **Conclusion: Why ""portScan""?**

This flow is classified as ""**portScan**"" because:

- **Single SYN probe** to a potentially random or nonstandard port,
- **No handshake completed** (just SYN, no ACK, no data),
- **No follow-up packets**, indicating the sender is probing, not trying to establish a real connection,
- **Pattern matches port scanning**, where an attacker sends SYN packets to many ports to see which are open (a common reconnaissance technique).

**In summary:**  
> **A single SYN packet to an uncommon port, without any further traffic, is the signature of a port scan attempt, not a normal connection or other attack type.**

---

**If you see many such flows from the same source to different ports or hosts, it further confirms port scanning activity.**


Explanation: 76

Let's break down the information in your network flow and explain **why it was classified as ""portScan""**:

### Flow Details

- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 51358  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.200.8  
- **Dest port:** 44442  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S. (SYN flag set)  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-15 00:42:25.864

---

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. **SYN Packet Only**
- The **Flags** field is `....S.`, which means **only the SYN flag is set**.
    - In TCP, a connection is initiated with a SYN packet.
    - If only a SYN packet is sent and nothing follows, it typically means the sender is trying to see if the port is open, not trying to communicate.

### 2. **Single Packet, Zero Duration**
- **Packets:** 1
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
    - Only one packet sent, and no reply or further communication.
    - This is typical for ""probing"" activity, not a real connection.

### 3. **Unusual Destination Port**
- **Dest port:** 44442
    - Not a common service port (like 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, etc.).
    - Port scans often target a **range of ports**, including uncommon ones, to find open services.

### 4. **No Data Transferred**
- **Bytes:** 58 (just enough for TCP/IP headers with SYN)
- No actual data transmitted, just the SYN request.

---

## **Why is this a ""portScan""?**

- **Port scanning** is an activity where an attacker (or scanner) sends packets (often SYN) to many ports on a target host to discover which ports are open and which services are available.
- The **most common scanning technique** is the SYN scan:
    - The attacker sends a SYN packet to a port.
    - If the port is open, the target replies with a SYN-ACK.
    - The attacker may then send a RST (reset) to avoid completing the handshake.
- In your flow, **only a SYN was sent, and nothing else happened**. This is a classic indicator of a port scan.
- Legitimate connections usually involve a SYN, followed by a SYN-ACK, then ACK, and then data transfer; this connection was not completed.

## **Summary Table**

| Feature              | Value            | Port Scan Reasoning                                      |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| TCP Flags            | ....S. (SYN)     | Only SYN sent; typical for scanning                      |

| Bytes                | 58               | Only header, no payload                                  |
| Dest Port            | 44442            | Unusual port, typical for port scan                      |

---

## **Conclusion**

This flow was classified as **""portScan""** because it matches the pattern of a SYN scan: a single SYN packet to an uncommon port, with no further communication. This is a typical technique used by attackers or security tools to map open ports on a remote host.

If you have multiple such flows from the same source to different destination ports, it would further confirm port scanning activity.


Explanation: 77

Let's break down the network flow attributes and the possible attack types:

### **Flow Attributes**
- **Timestamp:** 2017-03-21 13:03:53.732  
- **Duration:** 0.0 (very short, essentially instantaneous)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP / Port:** 192.168.200.2 : 9593
- **Destination IP / Port:** 192.168.220.16 : 38150
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 54
- **TCP Flags:** `.A.R..` (ACK and RST set)

### **TCP Flags Explained**
- **.A.R..** = **ACK** and **RST** are set; all other flags are not set.

### **Understanding Port Scans**
A **port scan** involves sending packets to a range of ports on a target to discover which ones are open, closed, or filtered. Common signs of a port scan include:
- A high number of connection attempts to different ports.
- Many flows consisting of a single packet with unusual TCP flag combinations (often SYN or RST/ACK).

### **Explanation for Classification as ""portScan""**
This flow **matches typical characteristics of a port scan** for the following reasons:

1. **Single Packet, Minimal Data:**  
   - Only 1 packet and 54 bytes exchanged.  
   - Normal connections usually involve more packets (e.g., SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, data, FIN).

2. **Immediate RST/ACK Flags:**  
   - The `.A.R..` (ACK + RST) flag combination typically means the connection was immediately reset.
   - This often happens when a connection is attempted to a port where no service is listening, or the host is rejecting the connection attempt.

3. **Zero Duration:**  
   - The flow lasted 0.0 seconds, indicating the connection attempt was immediately rejected or reset.

4. **Unusual Destination Port:**  
   - The destination port (38150) is high and not a standard service port, suggesting a scan rather than a legitimate connection attempt.

5. **Pattern of Port Scanning:**  
   - While you provided only one flow, in practice, port scans are detected by seeing many such flows from a single source IP to many destination ports.
   - This single flow fits the pattern: a ""hit"" on a possibly closed port, immediately rejected.

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute          | Value           | PortScan Indicator? |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Packets            | 1              | Yes                 |
| Bytes              | 54             | Yes                 |
| TCP Flags          | .A.R..         | Yes (RST/ACK)       |
| Duration           | 0.0s           | Yes                 |
| Dest Port          | 38150 (high)   | Yes                 |

---

## **Why Not Other Labels?**
- **""dos"":** Would involve many packets and/or high bandwidth—this is just one packet.
- **""bruteForce"":** Would involve multiple connection attempts to the same port (e.g., repeated logins).
- **""pingScan"":** Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **""---"":** Normal traffic usually involves a full handshake and more data.

---

## **Conclusion**
**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it matches the typical signature: a single, short-lived TCP packet to a non-standard port, immediately reset by the destination. This is the pattern produced when a scanner probes for open ports and the target rejects the attempt.**


Explanation: 78

Let's analyze the network flow and the reasoning for its classification as **""portScan""**:

---

### **Network Flow Attributes:**

- **Start time:** 2017-03-16 18:46:06.475  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Source port:** 53392  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.100.4  
- **Destination port:** 22939  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S. (Only SYN flag set)

---

### **Key Observations:**

1. **Single Packet, SYN Flag Only:**
   - The TCP flags show only the SYN flag is set (`....S.`).
   - In TCP, a SYN packet is used to initiate a connection (first step of the three-way handshake).

2. **No Established Connection:**
   - Only one packet sent, no response, and the flow duration is 0.0 seconds.
   - No evidence of a completed handshake or data transfer.

3. **Unusual Destination Port:**
   - The destination port 22939 is quite high and uncommon for typical services.

---

### **Why is this Port Scan?**

A **port scan** is when an attacker (or scanning tool) sends requests (typically SYN packets) to a range of ports on a target machine to discover which ports are open and might have services listening. The most common technique is sending a single SYN packet to each port (""SYN scan"" or ""half-open scan"").

**In this flow:**

- The source sent a single SYN packet to a specific port on the destination.
- There was no follow-up, suggesting the intent was to see if the port would respond rather than to establish a real connection.
- This pattern, especially if repeated across many ports (not shown here, but this is a single instance), is a hallmark of a port scan.

---

### **Why Not Other Categories?**

- **""dos"" (Denial of service):** Typically involves many packets and attempts to overwhelm a service. Here, only one packet.
- **""bruteForce"":** Would show multiple connection attempts, often with successful handshakes and data packets, likely targeting authentication services.
- **""pingScan"":** Would use ICMP (not TCP), sending ICMP Echo Requests (""pings"") to see if hosts are alive.
- **""---"" (Normal flow):** Normal flows usually have completed handshakes, data transfer, or more than just a single SYN packet.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute       | Value            | Port scan indicator?    |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Protocol        | TCP              | Yes (SYN scan uses TCP) |
| Flags           | SYN only         | Yes                     |
| Packets         | 1                | Yes                     |
| Duration        | 0.0 sec          | Yes                     |
| Dest port       | Unusual/high     | Yes (scan across ports) |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow is classified as a ""portScan"" because it consists of a single TCP SYN packet sent to a non-standard port, with no follow-up traffic. This is consistent with a typical port scanning technique, where an attacker probes ports to discover which ones are open, without actually establishing a connection or transferring data.**

If you had a series of such flows, each to a different port, the port scan pattern would be even clearer.

- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.100.5
- **Source port:** 1533
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Destination port:** 53392
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 54
- **TCP Flags:** .A.R..  
  (This means: ACK and RST flags set)

---

### **Key Observations**

1. **Single Packet, Very Short Duration:**
   - The flow consists of only **one packet** and lasted 0.0 seconds. This is typical for scan activity, where connections are not completed.

2. **TCP Flags:**
   - **Flags:** .A.R.. (ACK and RST set)
     - This is a characteristic response when a service is *not listening* on a port or when a connection attempt is refused. 
     - In port scans, probes are sent to many ports, and closed ports often reply with RST (Reset).

3. **Unusual Destination Port:**
   - The destination port is **53392**, which is a high, non-standard port. Port scans often target a range of ports (including high ports) to discover open services.

4. **No Data Exchange:**
   - Only a single packet was sent, and no further communication occurred—again common for a scan rather than a legitimate connection.

---

### **Why ""portScan""?**

A **port scan** occurs when an attacker or scanner sends packets to a range of ports on a host to determine which ports are open (and thus, which services might be vulnerable).

**In this flow:**
- The presence of a single packet with RST and ACK flags, targeting a high-numbered port, with no data exchange, strongly suggests that this was a *probing* connection, not a legitimate service communication.
- Legitimate connections typically involve a handshake and more data; a scan often results in a quick RST from the target.
- If this flow is part of a pattern (e.g., many such short-lived connections to different ports from the same source), it would further confirm a port scan.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Feature                | Value               | PortScan Indicator?        |
|------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| Packets                | 1                  | YES (scans are often single-packet)  |
| Duration               | 0.0                | YES (scans are very short) |
| TCP Flags              | .A.R..             | YES (RST, no handshake)    |
| Destination port       | 53392              | YES (high, non-standard)   |
| Data exchanged         | None (54 bytes)    | YES (just SYN/ACK/RST)     |

---

## **Conclusion**

This flow was classified as a **""portScan""** because:
- It is a single, short-lived packet to a high-numbered port.
- The TCP flags indicate the connection was immediately reset (not a real data communication).
- These are classic hallmarks of port scanning activity, where the attacker is probing to see if the port is open.

If this is part of a pattern from the same source IP to many ports, it would confirm the classification even more strongly.


Explanation: 80

Let's break down the attributes of your network flow:

- **Start time:** 2017-03-16 10:00:21.048  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 40166  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.2  
- **Dest port:** 1089  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S. (SYN flag set, others not set)  

### Why was this classified as a ""portScan""?

**Key indicators:**

1. **Single SYN Packet:**  
   The only packet in this flow has the SYN flag set (`....S.`), which means it is the start of a TCP handshake (a connection attempt). There is no ACK or any other flag, and only one packet is sent.

2. **No Response:**  
   The duration is 0.0 seconds, and only one packet is sent, suggesting that the destination did not respond or the scanner did not wait for a response.

3. **Unusual Destination Port:**  
   The destination port is 1089. This is not a common port for most services and could be part of a scan across many ports.

4. **Behavior Consistent with Port Scanning:**  
   Port scanning typically involves sending SYN packets to a series of ports on a target machine, waiting to see which ports respond (indicating an active service).  
   - If this flow is seen in the context of many similar flows from the same source IP to different destination ports (or even just one), it is indicative of a port scan.
   - Port scans often use just a SYN packet and don't follow through with the full handshake, especially if the scanner is just probing for open ports without actually connecting.

5. **Minimal Data Transfer:**  
   Only 58 bytes (enough for a TCP SYN packet) and only one packet.

### Why NOT the other labels?

- **Normal Flow (`---`):**  
  Normal traffic typically involves more than a single SYN; there would be a handshake and data exchange.

- **Denial of Service (`dos`):**  
  DOS would involve many packets, usually with the intent to overwhelm the target.

- **Brute Force (`bruteForce`):**  
  Brute force attacks typically involve repeated login attempts, not just SYN packets.

- **Ping Scan (`pingScan`):**  
  Would involve ICMP packets, not TCP SYN packets.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Suspected Attack | Evidence in this Flow                      | Conclusion              |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Port Scan        | Single SYN, no response, uncommon port     | **Likely**              |
| DoS              | Only 1 packet, not flooding                | Unlikely                |
| Brute Force      | No login attempts, just SYN                | Unlikely                |
| Ping Scan        | Not ICMP                                   | Unlikely                |
| Normal           | No handshake, no data                      | Unlikely                |

---

## **Conclusion**

This flow is classified as a **""portScan""** because it matches the classic pattern of a port scan: a single SYN packet sent to a possibly uncommon port, with no further communication. This is typical behavior when an attacker is scanning a host to discover which TCP ports are open, before deciding where to attack further.


Explanation: 81

Let's break down the flow attributes and explain why it was classified as a **portScan**:

### 1. **Flow Features**

- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-15 14:17:00.436
- **Duration:** 0.0 (very short, basically instantaneous)
- **Proto:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Src port:** 33168
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.1
- **Dest port:** 4224
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 58
- **Flags:** ....S. (only SYN flag set)

### 2. **Explanation of Features**

#### TCP SYN Scan Pattern

- **Only SYN flag set (....S.):**  
  - This is the first step in a TCP connection (""SYN"" packet).
  - A typical connection has at least a SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK (the three-way handshake).
  - A single SYN packet, with no response or further packets, often means the sender is probing to see if the port is open.

#### Single Packet, Single Byte Count

- **Packets: 1, Bytes: 58:**  
  - Only one packet was sent, and it's small, matching a typical TCP SYN packet size.
  - No reply, no established connection. The source is not trying to communicate, just to see if the port is open.

#### Very Short Duration

- **Duration: 0.0:**  
  - The flow lasted only as long as a single packet took to transmit.

#### Destination Port

- **Dest port:** 4224  
  - Not a common service port, suggesting the sender is probing a range of ports, not connecting to a known service.

### 3. **Why is this NOT a DoS, BruteForce, or PingScan?**

- **DoS:** Would involve many packets, often with repeated attempts or high traffic.
- **BruteForce:** Would show multiple login attempts, more packets, and possibly more bytes.
- **PingScan:** Would use ICMP, not TCP.

### 4. **Why is this a Port Scan?**

- **Port scanning** involves sending probes (often SYN packets) to a range of ports to discover which ones are open and listening.
- If you observe many such flows (single SYN packets to many ports), it is a classic sign of a port scan.
- **Even a single flow with these characteristics is often flagged as a possible scan, especially if many such flows are observed from the same source IP to different destination ports.**

---

## **Summary Table**

| Feature            | Value                 | Why It Suggests PortScan      |
|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| TCP Flags          | SYN only             | Probing if port is open      |
| Packets            | 1                    | No handshake, only probe     |
| Bytes              | 58                   | Typical size for SYN packet  |
| Duration           | 0.0                  | Only one packet sent         |
| Dest Port          | 4224 (uncommon port) | Likely part of scan sweep    |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it consists of a single SYN packet sent to an uncommon port, with no further communication, matching the pattern of a TCP SYN scan. This is a common technique used to map which ports are open on a target machine.**


Explanation: 82

Let's break down the flow attributes and the possible reasoning for labeling it as **""portScan""**:

### Flow Details Recap

- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-16 13:46:00.797  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.210.2  
- **Source port:** 711  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Destination port:** 47081  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 54  
- **Flags:** `.A.R..` (ACK, RST)

---

### Key Observations

1. **Single Packet, Immediate Termination**
   - Only **1 packet** transmitted, with a **duration of 0 seconds**.

2. **TCP Flags: `.A.R..` (ACK, RST)**
   - This means the packet had **ACK** and **RST** flags set.
   - Typical behavior: A host sends a TCP packet to a port, gets a response, and then sends an ACK+RST to tear down the connection attempt, or the host itself immediately sends a RST to reject a connection.

3. **High Destination Port**
   - Destination port **47081** is a high, likely ephemeral, port, often used in scans to probe for responses.

---

### Why ""portScan""?

A **port scan** is an activity where an attacker systematically sends packets to a range of ports on one or multiple hosts to discover open ports or services.

Here’s why this flow was classified as a **portScan**:

- **Unusual, isolated connection attempt:** A single packet sent to a high-numbered port, without further follow-up, is typical port scan behavior. Legitimate connections usually involve multiple packets (handshakes, data transfer), not just a single packet with an immediate reset.
- **RST+ACK flags:** Often, when a probe is sent to a closed port, the server responds with a RST packet. Alternatively, a scanning tool may send RST+ACK to quickly reset the connection attempt after receiving a response, or to avoid fully establishing a connection (such as in ""half-open"" scans or ""stealth"" scans like TCP SYN scans).
- **Pattern matches scanning:** Port scans often involve sending probes to many different ports (often high-numbered, non-standard ports) and not following up unless an interesting service is found.
- **Very short duration:** No actual communication is established; the connection is immediately terminated, a hallmark of scanning rather than actual service use.

---

### Summary

This flow is likely one of many similar flows, each targeting different ports. The combination of:
- **Single-packet flow**
- **Immediate reset**
- **High destination port**
- **No actual data exchange**

...strongly suggests a port scan, where the attacker is probing which ports are open on the target system, not trying to use any service.

---

**In short:**  
> The flow is classified as ""portScan"" because it matches the typical pattern of port scanning: a single TCP packet to a high-numbered port, immediately reset, with no data exchanged and no real connection established. This is classic reconnaissance behavior, not a legitimate service connection or other attack type.


Explanation: 83

Let's break down the **network flow attributes** and the **reasoning** behind its classification as `""portScan""`:

---

### **1. Flow Details**

- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-20 12:03:48.514  
- **Duration:** 0.0 (very short, almost instantaneous)
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 50151  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.100.4  
- **Dest port:** 44442  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S. (only SYN flag set)

---

### **2. What does this mean?**

- **Duration 0.0:** The flow started and ended almost instantly.
- **1 Packet, 58 Bytes:** Only a single packet was transmitted.
- **TCP Protocol, SYN Flag only:** The TCP packet sent had only the SYN flag set, which means it was trying to initiate a TCP connection (the first step in the TCP handshake).
- **Unusual Destination Port (44442):** This is a high-numbered, non-standard port.

---

### **3. Why is this a ""portScan""?**

A **port scan** is an activity where an attacker sends requests to a range of ports on a target machine to discover open ports and services. The most typical way this is detected:

- **Single SYN Packet:** Attackers often send a single SYN packet to check if a port is open (if the server replies with SYN-ACK, the port is open).
- **No data exchange / handshake completion:** Only the SYN is sent; the handshake is not completed.
- **Unusual port:** Not targeting standard service ports (like 80, 443, etc), but a high, potentially random port.

In your flow:

- **Only a SYN packet was sent** (“....S.” flag). No ACK, no further communication.
- **No data exchanged:** Only 1 packet, no further packets to complete the handshake.
- **Unusual port:** 44442 is not a common service port.
- **Very short duration:** Suggests it was not a normal connection attempt, but likely a probe.

**In summary:**  
This flow is typical of a **port scan**, where the source is probing the destination on a specific port to check if it is open. The behavior is different from normal traffic, which would attempt a full handshake and data exchange. The lack of data and the use of SYN-only packets to non-standard ports are classic signs of a port scan.

---

### **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**
- It was a single SYN packet (not a completed connection).
- It targeted an unusual, non-standard port.
- The flow was instantaneous, with no actual data exchanged.
- These attributes match the pattern of port scanning behavior, where attackers probe ports to identify possible points of entry.

Explanation: 84

Let's analyze the provided network flow and its classification as **""portScan""**:

### Flow Attributes Recap

| Field         | Value                |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Start Time    | 2017-03-16 13:46:11.685 |
| Duration      | 0.0                  |
| Protocol      | TCP                  |
| Src IP        | 192.168.210.3        |
| Src Port      | 901                  |
| Dest IP       | 192.168.220.16       |
| Dest Port     | 47080                |
| Packets       | 1                    |
| Bytes         | 54                   |
| Flags         | .A.R.. (ACK, RST)    |

---

### Key Points for Classification

#### 1. **Single Packet, Very Short Duration**
- The flow lasted **0.0 seconds** and only **1 packet** was sent (54 bytes).

#### 2. **TCP Flags: .A.R.. (ACK, RST)**
- The only packet had the **ACK** and **RST** (reset) flags set.
- No **SYN** flag, so this was **not a connection initiation**.

#### 3. **Unusual Source/Destination Ports**
- **Source port 901** to **destination port 47080**—these are both high, non-standard ports, suggesting this isn't a typical client-server connection.

#### 4. **Behavior Pattern**
- **Port scanning** often involves sending TCP packets to a range of ports (on the same or different hosts) to discover open or closed ports.
- A common scanning technique is to send packets **without a SYN flag** (e.g., ACK or RST), to try to evade firewalls or intrusion detection systems, or to map firewall rules (known as **ACK scan** or **RST scan**).
- The presence of an **ACK+RST** packet, without prior handshake, is typical of a scan designed to elicit a specific response from the target, or to test if the port is filtered or closed.

#### 5. **No Evidence of Attack Payload**
- There is no indication of multiple packets, sustained connection, or excessive traffic (which would indicate DOS).
- No repeated failed logins (which would indicate brute force).
- Not an ICMP (ping) packet (so not ping scan).
- Not a normal flow, as it doesn't follow the normal handshake and data exchange process.

---

### **Summary: Why ""portScan""?**

- The flow consists of a **single TCP packet** (no handshake) with **ACK+RST** flags, from a likely non-standard source to a high-numbered destination port.
- Such packets are commonly used in **TCP port scanning** to probe the status of ports without establishing a connection.
- There is **no payload or connection establishment**, just a probe.
- The characteristics do **not match DOS, brute force, or ping scan** attacks, nor normal traffic.

#### **Therefore:**
> **This flow was labeled ""portScan"" because it matches a typical pattern of port scanning, where a host sends minimal or specially crafted packets to probe ports, without attempting to establish a normal connection.**

Explanation: 85

Let's analyze your network flow and the reasoning behind its classification as **""portScan""**:

---

### **1. Flow Attributes Breakdown**

- **Date first seen**: 2017-03-21 04:44:09.091  
- **Duration**: 0.0 (very short, instantaneous)
- **Proto**: UDP  
- **Src IP**: 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port**: 137  
- **Dest IP**: 192.168.220.255  
- **Dest port**: 137  
- **Packets**: 1  
- **Bytes**: 92  
- **Flags**: ...... (no TCP flags; expected for UDP)

---

### **2. Key Observations**

- **UDP Protocol, port 137**:  
  UDP port 137 is used for NetBIOS Name Service, which is commonly used for network discovery on Windows networks.

- **Destination IP: 192.168.220.255**:  
  This is a **broadcast address** for the subnet 192.168.220.0/24. Sending to this address means the packet is intended for all hosts on the local network.

- **Source and Destination ports both 137**:  
  This is standard for NetBIOS name queries.

- **Single packet, 92 bytes**:  
  Indicates a single query or probe.

---

### **3. Why ""portScan""?**

#### **A. Typical Port Scanning Behavior**
- **Port scans** are attempts to discover which ports are open on a host or network by sending packets to those ports and analyzing the responses.
- In the case of UDP, a scan may send single packets to specific ports (like 137) to see if there's a service running.

#### **B. NetBIOS and Scanning**
- UDP port 137 traffic is often used for **NetBIOS Name Service** discovery, which can be leveraged for **network reconnaissance**.
- Sending a UDP packet to port 137 on the broadcast address will elicit responses from all machines running the NetBIOS service, quickly revealing active hosts and their names on the network.

#### **C. Why Not ""pingScan""?**
- A ""ping scan"" typically uses ICMP echo requests (""ping"") to see which hosts are alive, **not** UDP on port 137.
- Here, the use of UDP/137 suggests a scan specific to NetBIOS rather than a general ping sweep.

#### **D. Why Not ""dos"" or ""bruteForce""?**
- **Denial of Service (DOS)** usually involves flooding the network with many packets or connections, not a single probe.
- **Brute Force** attacks involve repeated authentication attempts or logins, not a NetBIOS name query.

#### **E. Why Not '---' (normal flow)?**
- In a typical environment, a single NetBIOS probe to the broadcast address might be normal, but it's also a classic **reconnaissance technique** used by attackers to enumerate hosts.
- Depending on the context and the detection policy, **any broadcast NetBIOS query** may be flagged as suspicious.

---

### **4. Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**

- It is a UDP packet sent to the NetBIOS Name Service port (137) on the network's broadcast address.
- This is a recognized method for network enumeration, allowing the sender to discover all hosts on the subnet responding to NetBIOS.
- Such activity fits the definition of a port scan, as it's probing for active services (NetBIOS) across multiple hosts simultaneously.

### **Summary Table**

| Label        | Reason for Selection/Exclusion                                      |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ---          | Not just normal traffic; it's a network-wide probe                  |
| dos          | Not a flood or disruptive attack                                    |
| portScan     | ✔ Network-wide probe for NetBIOS service (UDP/137, broadcast)       |
| bruteForce   | Not repeated auth attempts                                          |
| pingScan     | Not ICMP ""ping"", but UDP/137 NetBIOS probe                         |

---

**In short:**  
> **This flow is a classic example of a NetBIOS port scan using UDP to the broadcast address. It's a reconnaissance step to identify live hosts and their NetBIOS names, which is why it has been labeled as ""portScan"".**


Explanation: 86

Let's analyze the details of the flow and **why it was classified as ""portScan"":**

### **Flow Attributes**
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.100.2
- **Source Port:** 1054
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Destination Port:** 61477
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 54
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Flags:** `.A.R..` (ACK and RST set; no SYN)
- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-17 13:59:31.173

---

### **Key Observations**

1. **Single Packet, No Duration**
   - Only **one packet** was sent, and the flow lasted **0 seconds**.
   - This suggests a very brief connection attempt.

2. **TCP Flags: `.A.R..`**
   - **ACK** and **RST** are set.
   - No SYN (which would indicate the start of a normal TCP connection).
   - A packet with ACK and RST is typically sent as a response to an unexpected or unsolicited packet, or to quickly close a connection.

3. **High Destination Port**
   - The destination port is **61477**, which is a high, likely ephemeral, port.
   - Scanners often probe a wide range of ports, including high-numbered ports, to identify services or vulnerabilities.

4. **No Data Transfer**
   - Only 54 bytes were sent, which is consistent with a single TCP packet (could be just the header, no payload).

5. **Pattern Consistent with Port Scanning**
   - In a **port scan**, an attacker sends packets (often SYN packets) to a range of ports on a target system to determine which ports are open.
   - The normal response to a scan (especially to a closed port) is a packet with RST (reset), sometimes with ACK.
   - The observed packet here is likely the server's **response to a scan probe** (for example, a SYN probe to a closed port, resulting in an RST+ACK from the server).

---

### **Why this is likely a ""portScan"":**

- **Signature of a Scan:** The presence of a single TCP packet with RST+ACK flags, no payload, and targeting a high port, matches the signature of a port scan (where the scanner sends a probe and the server responds with RST+ACK if the port is closed).
- **No Evidence of Attack or Normal Traffic:** There's no sign of a sustained connection (as in brute force), no SYN flood (as in DoS), and this isn't an ICMP packet (so not a ping scan).
- **Pattern Recognition:** IDS/IPS systems and flow-based classifiers often use such patterns (many connections to different ports, single packet flows, RST responses) as an indicator of port scans.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute      | Value                | PortScan Reasoning  |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Packets        | 1                   | Typical of scan     |
| Bytes          | 54                  | Single header       |
| Duration       | 0.0                 | Instant/scan probe  |
| Flags          | .A.R.. (ACK, RST)   | Response to probe   |
| Dest Port      | 61477               | High port, likely scan |
| Protocol       | TCP                 | Common for scans    |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it matches the typical pattern of a TCP port scan:**
- A single TCP packet,
- With RST+ACK flags (typical response to scan probes on closed ports),
- No actual data transferred,
- Targeting a high port number,
- And a duration of 0 (indicating no real session was established).

Such characteristics are strong indicators of port scanning activity rather than legitimate use or other types of attacks.


Explanation: 87

Let's analyze the given network flow:

**Flow Attributes:**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-15 15:41:43.108
- **Duration:** 0.0 (very short, instantaneous)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source port:** 45411
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.210.4
- **Destination port:** 15660
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 58
- **Flags:** ....S. (**SYN** flag set, others not set)

**Why is this flow classified as a ""portScan""?**

### 1. **SYN Packet Only**
- The TCP flag is only **SYN** (`....S.`), which means this flow represents the initial attempt to establish a TCP connection (the first step of the TCP handshake).
- No ACK, PSH, RST, URG, or FIN flags are set.
- There is only one packet, and the duration is 0.0 seconds, indicating that the connection did not progress past the initial SYN packet.

### 2. **No Further Communication**
- Only one packet was sent, and no reply is recorded in this flow.
- This is typical of a scan, where the attacker is probing to see if the port is open, rather than trying to establish a full connection or transfer data.

### 3. **Unusual Destination Port**
- The destination port is **15660**, which is not a well-known or commonly used port. Attackers often scan a range of ports (including uncommon ones) to find services to exploit.

### 4. **Common Signature of Port Scanning**
- **Port Scanning** is often performed by sending SYN packets to multiple ports on a target machine to discover which ports are open and listening for connections.
- In a port scan, the attacker doesn't care about completing the connection; they just want to know which ports respond (either with SYN-ACK for open or RST for closed).
- Sending single SYN packets to a range of ports, with no further follow-up, is a hallmark of a port scan.

### 5. **Not a DoS, BruteForce, or Ping Scan**
- **DoS attacks** would involve many packets and possibly completed handshakes or data.
- **BruteForce attacks** would show repeated login attempts (multiple packets, data exchange).
- **Ping Scan** would use ICMP, not TCP.

## **Summary Table**

| Attribute                 | Value        | PortScan Reasoning                         |
|---------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| TCP Flags                 | ....S.      | Only SYN sent (probing for open port)      |
| Packets                   | 1           | Single probe, no data exchange             |
| Duration                  | 0.0         | Instantaneous, no handshake or session     |
| Dest Port                 | 15660       | Unusual, likely being scanned              |
| Protocol                  | TCP         | Port scans typically use TCP SYN probes    |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it is a single TCP SYN packet sent to an uncommon port, with no further communication. This pattern matches typical port scanning behavior, where an attacker probes a system to identify open ports by sending SYN packets and observing any responses.**

If you have multiple such flows from the same source IP to different destination ports on the same or different hosts, this would further strengthen the port scan classification.


Explanation: 88

Let's analyze the flow and the classification **""portScan""** step by step:

### Flow Details
- **Start time:** 2017-03-21 13:03:49.293
- **Duration:** 0.0 (instantaneous)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.200.3
- **Source port:** 1183
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Destination port:** 38148
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 54
- **TCP Flags:** `.A.R..` (ACK, RST set)
- **Classified as:** portScan

---

### Analysis

#### 1. **Duration & Packets**
- **Duration:** Zero seconds, indicating the flow was very short—essentially a single packet transaction.
- **Packets:** Only 1 packet sent, no ongoing conversation.

#### 2. **TCP Flags: .A.R..**
- **ACK (A):** Acknowledgment flag.
- **RST (R):** Reset flag. This usually indicates a connection was refused or reset.
- **No SYN:** The SYN flag is not set, so this is not an initial connection request.

A very common pattern in port scanning is sending packets to many ports and observing responses:
- If a port is closed, the target host may reply with a TCP packet with RST (reset) and ACK flags set.

#### 3. **Source/Destination Ports**
- **Source port 1183 → Destination port 38148**  
  The destination port is high and arbitrary, suggesting the source is probing many different ports.

#### 4. **Bytes**
- Only 54 bytes: This matches the size of a typical single TCP packet (likely just the headers, no application data).

#### 5. **Port Scan Behavior**
- In **port scanning**, an attacker systematically sends packets to a range of ports on a target machine to discover which ports are open, closed, or filtered.
- The attacker sends a probe (often a SYN or another type of TCP packet) to the target port.
- If the port is closed, the target often responds with RST+ACK. If open, the response differs (e.g., SYN+ACK in a SYN scan).

#### 6. **Why ""portScan""?**
- **Single packet, high destination port, RST+ACK flags, no data, and short duration:**  
  All these are classic hallmarks of a port scan, specifically the ""response"" a scanner receives when probing a closed port.
- **No attack activity:**  
  If this were a real connection (normal flow), there would likely be more packets, data transferred, and different flag combinations (e.g., SYN, SYN+ACK, ACK, data).
- **Not DoS:**  
  No evidence of flooding or repeated requests.
- **Not brute force:**  
  No repeated login attempts or authentication traffic.
- **Not pingScan:**  
  This is TCP, not ICMP.

### **Summary Table**

| Attribute         | Value                  | Port Scan Explanation                                    |
|-------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Packets           | 1                     | Single probe, typical for scans                          |
| Duration          | 0.0                   | No session, just probe and response                      |
| TCP Flags         | .A.R..                | Target replied with RST+ACK, typical to closed port scan |
| Dest Port         | 38148                 | High, arbitrary, typical in scanning                     |
| Bytes             | 54                    | Only header, no data, just a probe                       |

---

## **Conclusion**
**This flow was likely classified as ""portScan"" because it matches the typical pattern of a port scan attempt: a single TCP packet (likely a probe), to a (possibly random) high-numbered port, with the target responding immediately with RST+ACK (meaning ""connection refused""), and no session established. This is the fingerprint of a port scan, where the scanner is mapping the open/closed ports on the target host.**

**If you saw many flows like this to different destination ports from the same source IP, it would further confirm a port scanning activity.**


Explanation: 89

Certainly! Let’s break down the flow information and explain why it was classified as **""portScan""**:

### Flow Details

- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.100.6  
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src port:** 50150  
- **Dest port:** 1094  
- **Start time:** 2017-03-20 12:05:41.336  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **TCP Flags:** ....S. (Only the SYN flag is set)  

---

## Analysis

### 1. **Single SYN Packet**
- The only packet in this flow is a TCP packet with the **SYN** flag set (`....S.`).
- In TCP, a SYN packet is used to *initiate* a connection.

### 2. **No Further Communication (Duration = 0, Packets = 1)**
- There is only one packet (the SYN). No follow-up (no ACK, no data, no response).
- **Duration is 0.0** — suggests this was a very brief attempt, likely not a completed connection.

### 3. **No Data Transfer (Bytes = 58)**
- 58 bytes is typical for a TCP SYN packet header, no payload exchanged.

### 4. **Destination Port**
- The destination port is 1094. This is a non-standard port; not commonly used for typical services.

### 5. **Pattern Consistent with Port Scanning**
- **Port scanning** is a technique where an attacker sends SYN packets to many ports on a target host to discover open ports and services.
- Each port is typically probed with a SYN packet; the attacker waits for a SYN-ACK (indicating the port is open) or a RST (indicating closed).
- The attacker does **not** complete the handshake or send more data — only the SYN is sent.

### 6. **Why Not Other Attacks?**
- **Not a DoS**: A DoS attack would involve many packets, often to the same port, aiming to flood the service.
- **Not BruteForce**: Brute force attacks involve repeated login attempts, requiring more than just SYN packets.
- **Not PingScan**: Ping scans use ICMP echo requests, not TCP SYN packets.
- **Not Normal**: Normal flows would involve a completed handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and likely some data transfer.

---

## **Conclusion**

This flow matches the **signature of a port scan**:  
- A SYN packet to a potentially random port,  
- No completion of the handshake,  
- No data transfer,  
- Very short duration.

**That is why this flow was classified as ""portScan"".**  
It is indicative of a host probing ports to see which are open, rather than actually using the service.

**Summary Table:**

| Feature            | Value               | Port Scan?    |
|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| SYN only           | Yes                 | Yes           |
| Only 1 packet      | Yes                 | Yes           |
| No data transfer   | Yes                 | Yes           |
| Random port        | Yes (1094)          | Yes           |
| Short duration     | Yes (0.0)           | Yes           |
| No handshake/data  | Yes                 | Yes           |

**All signs point to port scanning activity.**


Explanation: 90

Let's break down the features of your network flow and explain why it was classified as a **""portScan""**:

## Flow Attributes Recap

- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Src port:** 33508
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.210.4
- **Dest port:** 8088
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 58
- **Flags:** ....S. (Only SYN flag is set)
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds

## What is a Port Scan?

A **port scan** is an activity where an attacker sends packets to a range of ports on a target machine to discover which ports are open, closed, or filtered. The most common type is a **SYN scan**, where only a SYN packet is sent to each port. If the port replies with SYN-ACK, it's open; if with RST, it's closed.

## Why is this flow a ""portScan""?

### 1. **Only SYN Packet Sent**
- The **Flags** value is `....S.`, which means **only the SYN flag is set**. No ACK, no data.  
- This is the classic behavior of a **TCP SYN scan** (sometimes called a ""half-open scan""), which is the most common port scanning technique.

### 2. **One Packet, No Data**
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58 (just the size of a TCP SYN packet)
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- This indicates the connection was never established—just probed.

### 3. **No Established Connection**
- The absence of an ACK or data from the initiator means the source isn't trying to actually communicate—just to see if the port is open.

### 4. **Common Pattern in Port Scans**
- Attackers usually send a SYN packet to a port to check if it's open, without completing the connection (no three-way handshake).
- This pattern is distinct from normal usage, where you would see at least SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK, followed by data transfer.

### 5. **Other Attack Types Don't Match**
- **DoS:** Would show many packets, possibly large data, and a persistent connection.
- **BruteForce:** Would show repeated connection attempts with authentication attempts.
- **PingScan:** Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **Normal:** Would have SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, and data packets exchanged.

## **Conclusion**

The flow matches the typical signature of a **port scan** (specifically a SYN scan):  
- A single SYN packet sent to a port,  
- No attempt to complete the handshake,  
- No data transferred,  
- All other flags unset.

**That is why this flow was classified as ""portScan"".**


Explanation: 91

Let's break down the attributes of your network flow and explain **why it was classified as ""portScan""**.

### Flow Details:

- **Start Time:** 2017-03-16 14:42:59.706  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  
- **Protocol:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.210.1  
- **Src port:** 1213  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Dest port:** 60387  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 54  
- **Flags:** .A.R.. (ACK, RST)

---

## 1. **Why NOT other attacks?**

- **Not ""dos"":** DoS attacks typically involve a high number of packets/bytes in a short duration, intending to overwhelm the target. This flow consists of only **1 packet**.
- **Not ""bruteForce"":** Brute force attacks involve repeated attempts to authenticate, often by sending multiple packets to the same service/port. Here, only a single packet is seen.
- **Not ""pingScan"":** Ping scans use ICMP, not TCP. This is a TCP packet.
- **Not ""---"" (normal):** The presence of a single TCP packet with specific flag combinations to a **high, unusual port** is suspicious.

---

## 2. **Why ""portScan""?**

**Port scanning** is the act of systematically sending packets to a range of ports on a host to find open ones, often sending a single probe to each port. Common characteristics of port scans include:

- **Short Duration:** Each flow is very brief (often 0.0 seconds).
- **Single Packet:** Each flow contains just one packet.
- **Random/High Ports:** The destination port (60387) is high and non-standard, which is typical for scans as the scanner checks multiple ports.
- **Flags:** The flags "".A.R.."" (ACK and RST set) are not common for normal connection establishment. In **TCP scanning techniques** (like ACK scan or RST scan), scanners may send packets with unusual flag combinations to elicit specific responses and map firewall rules or discover open/closed ports.

    - **ACK scan**: If a host responds with RST, it may indicate the port is unfiltered.
    - **RST scan**: Some tools send RST packets to see if the host is alive or to map firewall behavior.

- **No real connection:** No data is exchanged, just a single probing packet.

---

## 3. **Summary:**

**This flow is classified as ""portScan"" because:**
- It consists of a single TCP packet (not normal for legitimate connections).
- The destination port is high and non-standard, typical of scan activity.
- The TCP flags (ACK and RST) are consistent with certain port scanning techniques.
- The duration is zero, indicating no ongoing session.
- There's no evidence of a DoS, brute force, or ping scan attack.

**In short:**  
This flow matches the typical signature of a port scan, where an attacker sends a single packet with unusual TCP flags to a non-standard port to probe for open or filtered ports, without establishing a real connection or transmitting data.


Explanation: 92

Let's break down the flow attributes to explain **why it was classified as ""portScan""**:

### Flow Attributes:
- **Date first seen:** 2017-03-16 18:14:59.625  
- **Duration:** 0.0  
- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Src port:** 53392  
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.100.5  
- **Dest port:** 5904  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 58  
- **Flags:** ....S.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Packet, SYN Flag Only:**  
   - The flow consists of only **one packet** and the **TCP Flags** value is `....S.`, which means **only the SYN flag is set** (the start of a TCP connection).
   - This is characteristic of a ""connection attempt"" rather than an established session.

2. **No Response or Data Transfer:**  
   - **Duration is 0.0**, meaning the connection wasn't established or no further packets were exchanged.
   - **Only 58 bytes**—just enough for a TCP SYN packet, no payload.

3. **Unusual Destination Port (5904):**  
   - The destination port is **5904**, which is not a standard port. This may suggest scanning for open ports.

4. **Typical Port Scan Behavior:**  
   - In a **port scan**, an attacker sends SYN packets to many ports on a target machine to discover which ports are open (i.e., which ports respond to the SYN).
   - Each attempt looks similar: a SYN packet to a port, often with no further packets if the port is closed or filtered.

### Why Not Other Labels?
- **No attack / Normal flow:**  
  - Normal flows usually involve more than a single SYN packet—they establish a connection and exchange data.
- **Denial of Service (DOS):**  
  - DOS attacks usually involve **high packet rates** to the same port/service, not single SYN probes.
- **BruteForce:**  
  - BruteForce attacks typically have **multiple authentication attempts** (many packets, often to the same port like SSH/FTP).
- **Ping Scan:**  
  - Ping scans use ICMP packets, not TCP SYN.

### **Summary Table:**

| Attribute         | Value              | PortScan Reasoning                                   |
|-------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Protocol          | TCP                | Port scans use SYN packets to probe ports            |
| Packets           | 1                  | Only one SYN packet sent                             |
| Bytes             | 58                 | Minimal, just the SYN packet                         |
| TCP Flags         | ....S. (SYN only)  | SYN scan, classic port scan technique                |
| Destination port  | 5904               | Unusual port, likely probing for open services       |
| Duration          | 0.0                | No connection established, typical for port scans    |

---

## **Conclusion:**
**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it is a single, short-lived TCP SYN packet to an uncommon port, which is characteristic of scanning activity where an attacker probes multiple ports with SYN packets to find open ones.** There is no data transfer, and the pattern matches that of port scanning rather than normal use or other types of attacks.

Let me know if you need more detail or explanation about any part!


Explanation: 93

Let's analyze each field and see **why this flow is classified as a ""portScan""**:

---

**Flow Details**
- **Start time:** 2017-03-15 07:08:18.945
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds (very short, essentially instantaneous)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.200.3
- **Src port:** 37
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Dest port:** 51357
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 54
- **Flags:** .A.R.. (ACK and RST set)

---

## Step-by-Step Reasoning

### 1. **Very Short Duration, Only 1 Packet, 54 bytes**
- The flow lasted 0 seconds and only 1 packet was exchanged.
- This is typical for scans, where the scanner just wants to see if a port is open, not to establish a session.

### 2. **Flags: .A.R.. (ACK and RST set)**
- In TCP, a packet with **RST (Reset)** flag is used to abruptly terminate a connection or indicate a port is closed.
- **ACK** often appears in response packets.
- A flow with only ACK and RST, and no SYN, suggests that the connection attempt was not a normal handshake, but rather a probe or a scan.

### 3. **Unusual/High Destination Port**
- The destination port is 51357, which is a high, likely ephemeral port, often used in scanning to check which ports are open.

### 4. **Source Port 37**
- Source port 37 is unusual as a client port (it's the ""time"" protocol, but here it doesn't seem relevant), but attackers often use random or fixed source ports during scanning.

### 5. **No Attack, DoS, BruteForce, or PingScan?**
- **DoS** would involve more packets, longer duration, or more bytes.
- **BruteForce** would involve repeated attempts to authenticate (not seen here).
- **PingScan** would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **Normal flow** would involve more than just a single packet, and would usually include a SYN or a complete handshake.

### 6. **Why ""portScan""?**
- **Port scanning** typically involves sending packets to various ports to see which are open, closed, or filtered.
- The presence of just a single TCP packet with the ACK and RST flags strongly suggests the flow is not a part of a legitimate connection, but is instead a scan response or scan probe.
- In some scanning techniques (like ACK scan), the attacker sends TCP packets with the ACK flag set, and the response (RST) tells the scanner whether the port is unfiltered or filtered.
- The flow characteristics (very short, single packet, RST/ACK flags) match this behavior.

---

## **Summary Explanation (why ""portScan"")**

This flow was classified as **""portScan""** because:

- It consists of a single TCP packet with ACK and RST flags, which is not part of a normal connection, but rather a typical response to a **port scan probe** (such as SYN, ACK, or other scanning techniques).
- The flow is extremely short (0 seconds) and only transmits 1 packet (54 bytes), suggesting a probe rather than a real connection.
- The destination port is high, which is typical in port scans as attackers scan a range of ports.
- There is no evidence of a multi-packet attack (DoS), brute force login attempts, normal traffic, or ICMP-based activity (ping scan).

**In short:**  
**This network flow has all the hallmarks of a port scan: a single, very short TCP flow with RST/ACK flags, to a high-numbered port, which matches the typical signature of a TCP port scan.**


Explanation: 94

Let's break down the **network flow attributes** and see **why it was classified as ""portScan""**:

### Flow Attributes Recap
- **Start time:** 2017-03-15 14:20:43.464
- **Duration:** 0.0 (very short, possibly instantaneous)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.2
- **Source port:** 1296
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Destination port:** 33168
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 54
- **TCP Flags:** `.A.R..` (ACK, RST)

---

## **1. The key clues**

### a. **Single Packet with RST+ACK Flags**
- **Flags:** `.A.R..` means the packet has ACK and RST set, but not SYN, FIN, or PSH.
- Most ""normal"" TCP connections start with a SYN packet (the first step of the TCP handshake).
- A single packet with RST+ACK is often a **reset** in response to a packet that doesn't correspond to an active session.

### b. **Duration = 0.0**
- The flow lasted for zero seconds and consisted of only **one packet**.

### c. **High Destination Port**
- The destination port is a high ephemeral port (33168).

---

## **2. Why is this a Port Scan?**

### **How Port Scans Work**
- Port scanning is a technique used to identify open ports and services on a target machine.
- During a TCP port scan, an attacker will send probes (often SYNs) to many ports.
- If a port is **closed**, the target typically responds with an RST (reset).

### **Interpreting This Flow**
- This flow shows a **single TCP packet** with only RST+ACK, no SYN.
    - This likely means the attacker sent a SYN to 192.168.220.16:33168.
    - The destination replied with a RST+ACK, indicating that port 33168 is **closed** (there is no service listening on that port).
    - The flow records only the response (or is seeing only the response), which is typical in some flow monitors.

- **No Data Transfer, Only One Packet**
    - There’s no established connection, no data payload, only a probe and an immediate reset.
    - This pattern repeated across many ports is the signature of a port scan.

### **What It Is Not**
- **Not a DoS:** DoS involves many packets, usually to overwhelm a service.
- **Not BruteForce:** BruteForce involves repeated login attempts, often with application-layer data.
- **Not PingScan:** Ping scans use ICMP, not TCP.
- **Not Normal:** Normal flows have SYN, data packets, and FINs.

## **Summary Table**

| Feature         | Normal | PortScan | DoS | BruteForce | PingScan |
|-----------------|--------|----------|-----|------------|----------|
| 1 pkt, RST+ACK  |   ✗    |   ✔      |  ✗  |     ✗      |    ✗     |
| Duration = 0    |   ✗    |   ✔      |  ✗  |     ✗      |    ✗     |
| High dest port  |   ✗    |   ✔      |  ✗  |     ✗      |    ✗     |

---

## **Final Explanation**

> **This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it consists of a single, instantaneous TCP packet with only the RST+ACK flags set, to a high-numbered port. This is a classic response to a TCP port scan probe, where the attacker is checking if a port is open. The absence of a real connection, no data transfer, and the presence of a reset is characteristic of a port scan, not normal traffic or other attack types.**

### **Flow Details Recap**

- **Protocol**: TCP  
- **Source IP**: 192.168.220.16, **Source port**: 52086
- **Destination IP**: 192.168.210.1, **Destination port**: 20222
- **Packets**: 1, **Bytes**: 58
- **TCP Flags**: ....S. (only SYN is set)

---

### **Step-by-step Reasoning**

#### 1. **Single Packet, SYN Flag Only**
- The flow consists of **a single TCP packet**.
- The TCP flags show **only the SYN flag is set** (`....S.`).
- This means the packet is likely the **first step in a TCP handshake** (SYN), but there is no follow-up (no ACK, no data transfer).

#### 2. **No Duration, No Data, No Response**
- **Duration = 0.0**: The flow was extremely brief, with no ongoing connection.
- **No further packets**: Only the initial SYN, no SYN-ACK or ACK, which suggests the connection did not proceed.

#### 3. **Unusual Destination Port**
- **Destination port = 20222**: This is a non-standard port (not HTTP, SSH, etc.), which can raise suspicion, as scans often target random or non-standard ports to identify open services.

#### 4. **Common Port Scan Signature**
- **Port scanning** tools (like Nmap) typically send SYN packets to many ports to see which ones respond, indicating a service is listening.
- **""SYN scan""** is the most common type: send a SYN, see if a SYN-ACK comes back (open), or RST (closed), or no response (filtered).  
- This flow matches that pattern: **single SYN to a port**.

#### 5. **Attack Labels Analysis**
- **DoS**: Would involve many packets or evidence of overwhelming traffic.
- **BruteForce**: Would show repeated attempts to authenticate, likely multiple packets and flows.
- **PingScan**: Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **Normal (""---"")**: A single SYN to a random port is unusual in normal traffic, unless the client is genuinely connecting to an unusual service.

---

### **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because:**

- It consisted of a **single SYN packet** (no completed connection, no data transfer).
- It targeted a **non-standard port**, which is typical behavior for port scanning.
- This pattern (single SYN, no further communication) is a classic indicator of a **SYN scan**, which is a type of port scan used to discover open ports/services on a target machine.

**In summary:**  
> A single TCP SYN packet to an uncommon port, with no follow-up, is a strong signature of a port scan attempt, which is why this flow was classified as ""portScan"".

Explanation: 96

Certainly! Let’s break down **why this network flow with the given attributes was classified as a ""portScan""** attack.

---

### 1. **Flow Attributes Recap**

- **Proto:** TCP  
- **Source IP:** 192.168.100.1  
- **Source Port:** 33354  
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.16  
- **Destination Port:** 50151  
- **Packets:** 1  
- **Bytes:** 54  
- **Flags:** `.A.R..` (ACK and RST set)  
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds  

---

### 2. **What is a Port Scan?**
A **port scan** is an activity where an attacker sends packets to a series of ports on one or more target hosts to discover open, closed, or filtered ports. The goal is to identify services and possible vulnerabilities.

---

### 3. **Why is this flow a port scan?**

Let’s analyze the **indicators:**

#### **a. Single Packet, Short Duration**
- The flow contains **only one packet** and lasted **0.0 seconds**.
- Port scans often involve sending single packets to many ports, one after another, to quickly gather responses about which ports are open or closed.

#### **b. TCP Flags: `.A.R..` (ACK and RST)**
- **ACK (A)** and **RST (R)** are set.
- This usually indicates that the responder (destination) is telling the sender that the port is **closed or not listening**.
- In port scans, especially **TCP connect scans** or **SYN scans**, if a port is closed, the target sends back a TCP packet with RST (reset) flag set, possibly with ACK.
    - For example, if someone sends a SYN to a closed port, the server typically responds with RST-ACK.

#### **c. No Data Transferred**
- Only **54 bytes** (typical for a minimal TCP header, no payload).
- Indicative of a scan, not real data transfer.

#### **d. High, Unusual Destination Port**
- **Destination port 50151** is a high, non-standard port.
- Scanners typically probe a range of ports, including such high numbers, rather than just well-known service ports.

---

### 4. **Summary of Classification Reasoning**

- **Single packet** with **no real data** and **RST+ACK** flags is a hallmark of a response to a scan attempt, not real application traffic.
- The **high destination port** suggests probing for unknown or less common services.
- The **very short duration** and **lack of a TCP handshake or data exchange** further reinforce the scan pattern.

**In summary:**
> This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it matches the typical fingerprint of a port scan: a single, minimal TCP packet to a high-numbered port, with a response indicating the port is closed, and no actual data transfer or session established.

Explanation: 97

Let's break down the flow attributes and see why it was labeled **""portScan""**:

### Flow Attributes

- **Duration**: 0.0 seconds (very short, almost instantaneous)
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Source IP**: 192.168.220.16
- **Source Port**: 45411
- **Destination IP**: 192.168.210.4
- **Destination Port**: 1036
- **Packets**: 1
- **Bytes**: 58
- **TCP Flags**: ....S. (only the **SYN** flag is set)

### Analysis

#### 1. **SYN Only Packet**
- The only flag set is **SYN**. 
- This is typical of the first packet in a TCP handshake, used to initiate a connection.

#### 2. **Only One Packet, No Response**
- The flow duration is **0.0**, meaning only a single packet was observed, and it was not followed by an ACK, SYN-ACK, or other handshake continuation.
- No data was exchanged; only the connection initiation was attempted.

#### 3. **Unusual Destination Port**
- The destination port (**1036**) is not a common service port (like 80, 443, 22, etc.).
- Port scans often target a wide range of ports, including uncommon ones, to discover open services.

#### 4. **No Payload, No Continued Communication**
- Only one packet, no further communication — a pattern typical in **port scanning**, where an attacker sends SYN packets to multiple ports to see which ones respond (indicating they're open).

#### 5. **Not Typical of Other Attack Types**
- **DoS**: Would involve many packets, often to a single target, overwhelming the service.
- **BruteForce**: Would involve multiple connection attempts, with repeated login tries.
- **PingScan**: Would use ICMP, not TCP.
- **Normal**: Would usually complete the handshake and possibly transfer data.

### **Conclusion**

This flow is labeled **""portScan""** because:
- It consists of a single **SYN** packet to an uncommon port, 
- with no completion of the handshake,
- no further traffic,
- and this behavior is a classic signature of a **TCP SYN scan**, a common port scanning technique.

**Port scanning** is used by attackers to discover which ports on a target are open and listening for connections, often as a precursor to a more targeted attack.

**This matches the behavior of a port scan, not other attack types or normal traffic.**


Explanation: 98

Let's analyze your network flow and the reasoning behind its classification as **""portScan""**.

### Flow Attributes Breakdown

| Attribute         | Value                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Start Time**    | 2017-03-17 17:53:19.923       |
| **Duration**      | 0.0                           |

| **Flags**         | ....S. (Only SYN flag set)    |

---

### Key Observations

1. **Only 1 Packet Sent:**  
   The flow contains just a single packet, which is characteristic of scan attempts rather than normal communication or attacks that involve sustained traffic (like DoS or brute force).

2. **TCP SYN Flag Set:**  
   The flag is `....S.` (SYN flag). This means the packet is a **TCP SYN** packet, which initiates a new TCP connection.

3. **Destination Port (49):**  
   Port 49 is typically used for **TACACS+** (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus), a protocol used for authentication and authorization.

4. **No Established Connection:**  
   The flow's duration is 0.0, and there is no evidence of a completed handshake (no ACK or further packets).

---

### Why is this **""portScan""**?

A **port scan** is a reconnaissance technique used by attackers to find open ports and available services on a target machine. The classic way to do this is to send **SYN packets** to a range of ports and observe which ones respond, indicating the port is open.

**This flow matches that behavior:**
- **A single SYN packet** is sent from one host to another, targeting a specific port.
- **No further communication** occurs in this flow (no data transfer, no ACK, etc.).
- The intent is likely to check if port 49 is open on 192.168.210.5, not to establish a real connection.
- Port scans often consist of many such flows, each to a different port, but even a single SYN probe can be classified as a scan in automated systems.

#### Why not the other labels?

- **""---"" (Normal):** Normal traffic would involve a handshake and data transfer.
- **""dos"":** DoS attacks generate many packets, usually to exhaust resources, not just a single SYN.
- **""bruteForce"":** Brute force attacks are characterized by repeated authentication attempts, not just single SYNs.
- **""pingScan"":** Ping scans use ICMP Echo Requests, not TCP SYN packets.

### **Summary Table**

| Reason for ""portScan"" Classification         | Evidence in Flow                                      |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| SYN packet only (no handshake/data)          | Flags field: ....S.                                   |
| Only 1 packet, 58 bytes                      | Packets: 1, Bytes: 58                                |
| Targeting a specific port                    | Dest port: 49                                         |
| Reconnaissance behavior                      | Pattern matches automated scan, not actual connection |

---

## **Conclusion**

**This flow was classified as ""portScan"" because it is a single TCP SYN packet sent to a specific port, with no follow-up communication. This is a classic indicator of a port scan, where the attacker is probing ports to see which ones are open.**

If you see many such flows from the same source IP to different destination ports (or even just one), it's almost certainly a scan.


Explanation: 99

Let's break down the network flow attributes and explain **why it was classified as ""portScan""**:

### Flow Attributes
- **Start time:** 2017-03-16 10:02:52.759
- **Duration:** 0.0 (very short, almost instantaneous)
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Source port:** 40166 (ephemeral port)
- **Destination IP:** 192.168.220.1
- **Destination port:** 5004
- **Packets:** 1 (only one packet transmitted)
- **Bytes:** 58
- **Flags:** ....S. (**SYN** flag set only)

---

## **Why is this classified as ""portScan""?**

### 1. **SYN Packet Only**
- The only TCP flag set is **SYN** (`....S.`).
- SYN packets are used to initiate a TCP connection (part of the three-way handshake).
- If only a SYN packet is sent and no further packets follow (no ACK, no data), this often indicates a probe rather than a legitimate connection attempt.

### 2. **Single Packet, Zero Duration**
- The flow consists of just **one packet** and has a **duration of 0.0 seconds**.
- This means there was no response from the destination, and no actual connection was established.

### 3. **Common Pattern in Port Scanning**
- Port scanning tools (like Nmap) often send SYN packets to a range of ports to see which ones respond, without completing the connection. This is called a **SYN scan** or ""half-open scan"".
- If the port is open, the server responds with SYN-ACK (not seen here).
- If the port is closed, the server responds with RST, or nothing at all.

### 4. **No Attack Behavior Observed**
- There is no evidence of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack (no flood of packets).
- There is no evidence of brute force (no repeated login attempts).
- It's not a Ping Scan (which would use ICMP Echo requests, not TCP SYN).

---

## **Summary**

**This flow is classified as ""portScan"" because:**
- It consists of a single, short-lived TCP SYN packet from a source to a destination port, with no follow-up communication.
- This pattern is typical of a port scan, where an attacker probes ports to see which ones are open, without establishing full connections.
- The lack of other traffic (no data, no further packets) and the presence of only the SYN flag are classic signatures of a SYN scan (a common port scanning technique).

---

**In short:**  
> **A single SYN packet (with no follow-up), short duration, and no data transfer is a hallmark of port scanning activity, which is why this flow was classified as ""portScan"".**


Explanation: 100

Let's break down the flow attributes and the reasoning behind the **""portScan""** classification:

---

### Flow Attributes:

- **Start time:** 2017-03-16 10:02:04.045
- **Duration:** 0.0 seconds
- **Proto:** TCP
- **Src IP:** 192.168.220.16
- **Src port:** 40166
- **Dest IP:** 192.168.220.1
- **Dest port:** 3168.0
- **Packets:** 1
- **Bytes:** 58
- **Flags:** ....S.  (**SYN** flag set, others not set)

---

## Why is this a ""portScan""?

### 1. **SYN-Only Packet**
- The only TCP flag set is **SYN** (`....S.`).  
- This means the flow is **a single, initial connection attempt** (SYN packet) from the source to the destination port.
- There is **no ACK, no data transfer, no continuation**—just a SYN.

### 2. **Zero Duration, One Packet**
- **Duration is 0.0** and **only one packet** sent.
- This indicates that the source is only ""probing""—not establishing a session or transferring data.

### 3. **Typical of Port Scans**
- Port scanning tools (like Nmap) often send SYN packets to many ports on a target, just to see which ones reply (""SYN scan"").
    - If a port is open, the target sends back a SYN-ACK.
    - If closed, the target sends a RST.
    - The scanner does not complete the handshake—just sends a SYN and waits.
- This pattern (many SYNs, no completed sessions) is **the hallmark of a port scan**.

### 4. **Distinction from Other Attack Types**
- **DOS**: Usually involves many packets, often flooding the target.
- **BruteForce**: Involves repeated logins, multiple packets, data transfer.
- **PingScan**: Uses ICMP, not TCP SYN.
- **Normal flow**: Would involve at least a completed handshake, more packets, data transfer.

---

## **Summary**

This flow is a single **TCP SYN packet** from one IP to a specific port on another IP, with no further communication.  
**This is typical behavior of a ""port scan"",** where an attacker sends SYN packets to many ports to discover which are open, without completing TCP handshakes or sending data.

**That's why it was classified as ""portScan"".**"
